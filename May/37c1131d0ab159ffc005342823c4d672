The Stormers have been forced to make a number of changes for the PRO14 Rainbow Cup SA encounter with the Bulls at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. The North-South clash will kick-off at 6.15pm. Hooker Bongi Mbonambi starts in the only change to the front row, while David Meihuizen is at lock in place of JD Schickerling who injured his ankle against the Sharks last week. Flank Nama Xaba also picked up an ankle injury at training this week and has been replaced by Marcel Theunissen, with Evan Roos at No 8 and Willie Engelbrecht among the replacements this week.

Dan du Plessis starts at outside centre, with Ruhan Nel having joined the Springbok Sevens team and Leolin Zas and Sergeal Petersen start on the wings, with Seabelo Senatla suspended.
