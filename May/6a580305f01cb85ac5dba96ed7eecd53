After testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud just a few hours ago, former Transnet chief financial officer Anoj Singh is back on Friday morning. Singh told commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo during his testimony in March he had four safety vaults for his family members at Knox Vault in Killarney, Johannesburg.
