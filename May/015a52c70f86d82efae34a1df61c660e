Tira has supported the rise of many artists and the push for gqom music. Tira said the year 2020 was a huge loss of income for many, the reason why he created Afro Nights that celebrates musicians who have been influential over the years. “Often at times what the ‘soft life’ people display on social media is not true. It’s easy to hide things and only show people what you want them to see. You don’t have a full view of the person’s finances, only a glimpse of the make-believe big picture,” he said.
