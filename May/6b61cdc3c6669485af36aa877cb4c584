Despite plans to begin reopening the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital on Monday after a fire last month forced its closure, the doors remain closed to patients. While the vaccination site was buzzing with health workers queuing for vaccinations, security guards at the hospital’s busy gates would not allow people near the section of the hospital that was destroyed by the fire. The Citizen is still waiting for the department to respond to questions. Earlier on Monday, Jacaranda FM reported the hospital was still waiting for a certificate of compliance from the city of Johannesburg.
