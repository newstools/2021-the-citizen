Before the first leg, he also told Sky Sports Arabia: “It’s always good that a big team like Al Ahly to be interested in me. I’m very focused on keep playing well to appear and then we’ll see what happens,” Sirino told Sky News Arabia. “I want to thank the Al Ahly fans for their love. It would be a great challenge if I could someday wear this shirt.” Good Morning to all beautiful and handsome soccer loving people out there. We are blessed. Sundowns players and its fans have a lot in their plate????how do you wear an AHLY jersey? Yes Pitso is there, but the disrespect to the Brand is too much. Sirino and Onyango must be fined. pic.twitter.com/ttGPKadN5G — Mahlatse  Ratau???????? (@BanaMalome) May 20, 2021  Mngqithi, at a press conference on Thursday ahead of the second leg, said: “I would prefer not to comment on that. I don’t think it is appropriate to do that, but it is something I don’t want to dwell on, I want to focus on winning the match, instead of other negative things. I can say something negative about the same player and on Saturday he wins the match for us.”
