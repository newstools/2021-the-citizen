The Eastern Cape ANC’s provincial integrity commission (PIC) has cleared Premier Oscar Mabuyane of wrongdoing in the University of Fort Hare (UFH) registration scandal. Mabuyane announced the PIC’s decision in a statement on Tuesday saying he had voluntarily subjected himself to the PIC. “The PIC had looked into the matter, it is of the view that based on the information before it, there is no unethical or fraud-related conduct on Mr Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane’s part of that, as a result, the PIC recommends that his name be cleared,” said the premier’s spokesperson, Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha. In March, Mabuyane, who is also the ANC’s provincial chair, was deregistered from UFH’s master’s programme for not meeting minimum requirements.
