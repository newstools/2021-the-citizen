When you are a parent, living in a clean house can feel like an impossible mission. Household chores can create a lot of resentment for moms who feel like the responsibility of cleaning the house rests on their shoulders. Household chores don’t have to be mom’s job alone. Kids can also take up some chores that are appropriate for their age. They can learn and understand that every member of the household has to be accountable for some cleaning up. Cleanipedia,  a home cleaning expert, have compiled an age-by-age guide for children to help out around the house. It may be challenging to reason with younger children on taking up household responsibilities. With a little guidance, they can contribute to smaller household tasks, especially if they are responsible for the mess. Children in this age group develop independence and a flair for solving problems. So, why not let them help out with more complex house chores. From nine to preteen, children have a better understanding of social names and appropriate behaviours. They are then more than capable of playing a more active role in helping out around the house. Here, parents can supervise their almost-adult children to take up responsibilities solely. At this stage, they know what is expected of them, although you would have to remind them now and again. Cleaneapedia recommends that parents should draw up a chore chart list using the below guidelines.
