A circus lion has attacked a trainer during a show which was caught on camera by a patron in Russia. The video shows two lions entering the secured and fenced dome with the circus trainer walking in after them. As the lions were rolling around, wrestling with each other, the one lion attacked the trainer, grabbing him by the leg which led to him falling to the ground. The crowd of spectators gasped in horror as the trainer freed himself from the lion’s grip and tried to calm the lion with sticks, but the lion seemed restless and agitated.  The lion attacked the circus trainer for the second time, grabbing his foot once again, slightly dragging him on the ground after his second fall. The video ends with the circus trainer freeing himself from the lion once again and making his way out of the dome to safety.
