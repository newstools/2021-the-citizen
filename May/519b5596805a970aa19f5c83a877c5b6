Actors who build careers in action and superhero movies particularly as leads, usually have bodies fit for the role. Will Smith is one of them. Despite turning 50 a few years ago, Smith has always prided himself on a healthy lifestyle and a consistent fitness regime. However, that all changed because of the pandemic. Like many others around the world, Smith wasn’t immune to the fact people had more time on their hands and also ate more. Being honest this week, he wrote: “I’m gonna be real wit yall – I’m in the worst shape of my life.”   A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith)  Y’all stanning Will Smith’s body but blocking men on dating apps with the same physique. — say less, do more (@Dommlifts) May 4, 2021  I love Will Smith for embracing his body publicly  that’s so dope to me pic.twitter.com/xqRjKf0BRv — Amir.
