Malephane was handed 20 years in jail and is expected to testify against Shoba in court. Last week Shoba told the court there were threats against his life and he feared for his safety. He lodged an application to be kept in custody at the Krugersdorp correctional facility after the court transferred him to the Johannesburg Prison ahead of the start of his trial in the high court on Friday. He was twice denied bail. On 5 June 202, the community of Durban Deep in Roodepoort was shocked at the discovery of Pule’s body, who had been stabbed and left hanging from a tree. Pule, from Soweto, was eight months pregnant at the time of her death. Shoba was reportedly the father of Pule’s unborn baby. Additional reporting by Bernadette Wicks.
