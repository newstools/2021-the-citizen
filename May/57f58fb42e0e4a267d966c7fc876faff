Two of South Africa’s favourite couples got together this past weekend for a beautiful getaway. Minnie Dlamini-Jones and his husband Quinton Jones were in Cape Town with Siya and Rachel Kolisi. The couples, with baby Netha on board, hit a luxury villa in Hermanus which is a breathtaking location on its own.

This might have been the downtime that Minnie needed, after a week of sports gigs. She hosted an event to celebrate the comeback of the Carling Black Label Cup.

The television host was already in work mode in December 2020, a month after Netha was born, even announcing the production of her first movie. She never deprived herself of some time out, though, meeting with friends for “a much-needed girl’s night”.

On Siya Kolisi’s Instagram post, some users commented about the beautiful display of SA’s rainbow nation. A follower Tedy Mazibuko said “a Zulu, coloured, umXhosa and a beautiful white lady”. “This picture represents the South Africa we want, one love,” says Wendy Koch commenting on the picture.
