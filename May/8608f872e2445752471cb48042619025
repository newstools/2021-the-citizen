Companies and people are sometimes registered to provide basic advisory services for a low risk product, but then offer services of a far more complex and risky nature. Consumers can contact the FSCA on the toll free number 0800 110 443 or its website, www.fsca.co.za, to find out if an institution or person is authorised to render financial services.
