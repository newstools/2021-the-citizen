A game ranger student from Scotland was seriously injured after being attacked by a black rhino in northern Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday. According to IPSS Medical Rescue, the student was on foot in a private game reserve when he was trampled and gored by the rhino. After being called to the scene, search and rescue teams and anti-poaching units in the area located the student and stabilised him before evacuating him.
