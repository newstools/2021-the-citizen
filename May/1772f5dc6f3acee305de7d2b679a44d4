A hijab is a religious veil worn by Muslim women in the presence of any male outside of their immediate family, which normally covers the hair, head and chest. The word hijab explains the act of covering up ordinarily, but is often used to illustrate the headscarves worn by Muslim women. In its traditional form, it is worn by women to maintain modesty from males who aren’t relatives. Hijabs can be found in many different colours and styles and can be worn in different ways. A hijab is not to be confused with a burka, niqab, al-amira or shayla which all cover the head in keeping with modesty.
