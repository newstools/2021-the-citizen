It has been just about three weeks since Kiernan Forbes known as AKA lost his fiancée Anele “Nellie” Tembe at the Pepperclub Hotel in Cape Town. AKA said in a statement he had lost the love of his life and asked that both families be given privacy. Posting a quote on his Instagram page on Wednesday, it read: “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” The post comes as he is due to perform at radio station 947’s popular music concert, Huawei Joburg Day on 28 May. Radio host Anele Mdoda posted a promotional poster on social media with AKA still on as one of the acts  to perform in the virtual concert. Another artists include Micasa, GoodLuck, DJ Zinhle and Prime Circle.   A post shared by Anele Mdoda (@zintathu)  The concert is on Friday, 28 May from 4-7pm and streamed live. AKA said the loss of Tembe had been hard for him to process, even more so because of the “insinuations” and “innuendos” made against him about how and why Anele died. “I lost the love of my life…and every day feels like a mountain to climb. I miss Anele, so much, and I’m heartbroken at the unfulfilled life we had planned together,” AKA said in his statement.
