A Citybug bus driver saved the day when he avoided what could have been a disastrous head-on collision on the N3 towards Durban on 16 May. In a video shared on Facebook by Marthinus de Bruin who was on the bus, a car can be seen driving on the wrong lane towards the bus. The driver sees the car and drives away, avoiding an accident that could have possibly ended people’s lives. “By the grace of God and good driver ability, [the car] missed our bus with 25 passengers. Thank you Jesus for keeping our bus and passengers safe,” he said. Watch the video below:  Later on 16 May, Arrive Alive reported a head-on collision on the N3 (westbound), Cato Ridge at around 3pm.
