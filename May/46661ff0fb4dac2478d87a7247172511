Unveiled last year in the US where it carries the Crosstrek designation, the local arm of Subaru has confirmed pricing details of the facelifted XV. Arriving on the back of the revised Forester and Outback, the XV receives a restyled grille and new front bumper, redesigned fog light surrounds, 17-inch alloy wheels on the entry level model and 18-inch alloys on the top spec S-ES. No changes have taken place at the rear. New on the colour side is Plasma Yellow Pearl that replaces Sunshine Orange and Horizon Blue Pearl in place of Quartz Blue Pearl. Unlike in the States though, the Crosstrek Sport does not make it to South Africa and is badged the XV Sport. RELATED: Subaru XV given more kit and grunt in the States Minor changes have taken place inside, though, where both models continue to offer an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a sunroof, up to four USB ports and for the first time, an electrically adjustable driver’s seat with memory function. Now fitted as standard with the SI-Drive system that offers two modes; Intelligent and Sport, the XV also benefits from the updated EyeSight system made-up of a new front camera, Adaptive Cruise Control, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Lane Change Assist, Reverse Automatic Braking, Automatic Pre-Collision Braking and Lane Departure Warning. Eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system is standard on both models. Underneath the bonnet and despite the Crosstrek being offered with the normally aspirated 2.5-litre flat-four used in the Forester and Outback, the local market XV remains motivated by the 115kW/196Nm 2.0-litre flat-four paired to the Lineartronic CVT. Ground clearance is still rated at 220 mm. Despite the subtle revisions, the XV’s prices are unchanged with the entry-level model retailing from R445 000 and the S-ES from R509 000. Standard on both is a five year/100 000km warranty as well as a three year/75 000km maintenance plan.
