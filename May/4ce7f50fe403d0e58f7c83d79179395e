Former finance minister Malusi Gigaba used his appearance at the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture on Thursday to rip apart Norma Mngoma’s testimony. Gigaba said he did not agree with anything Mngoma said in her affidavit, and said pretty much everything she claimed was fabricated. He also slated her for “disrespecting” his father and brother-in-law, and also for dragging their children into the drama.
