Last week, Kelly Khumalo’s son Christian Khwezi Khumalo turned 11 years old; His party this weekend was all sorts of super. The intimate party had a few of Khwezi’s friends and even the adults dress up. Kelly pulled up to the party with a Wonder Woman suit and had her superhero pose ready. “When we are not in between Kingdoms we are saving the World”, Kelly wrote on Instagram.   A post shared by The Voice Of Africa (@kellykhumaloza)  Her suit and poses had her followers excited, some commenting: “Shifter Spiderman, there’s a new hero in town.” This comes after the recent videos of the dancing Spiderman trending nationally. Kelly’s friend, Brenda Mtambo, said she killed the look and another follower said she looks like a true Spartan. Khwezi chose to be Spider-Man for his birthday and was spotted standing next to Batgirl. Spider-Man seems to be a kid’s favourite, even Nandi Madida’s requesting the dancing Spider-Man to be his party mascot.
