During the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) virtual meeting on Sunday, its treasurer-general, Paul Mashatile, said the party was now mulling cutting its staff by 50%. Sources verified a leaked recording that News24 has in its possession. They claimed Mashatile told the meeting the party would have to cut staff members. At the meeting, he said the organisation was looking at “right-sizing” itself. “Officials have agreed that we’ve probably had to cut our staff by 50%. But those reports will come to the NEC. A lot of work is being undertaken. Comrade Febe is leading the process of restructuring and right-sizing,” he added.
