Lions coach Ivan van Rooyen has largely been able to pick the same team that just came up short against the Stormers in Joburg last week for Saturday’s fourth round Rainbow Cup SA match against the Bulls at Ellis Park. The only change is in the backrow and that’s forced because of an injury to exciting loose-forward Francke Horn. His place is taken by the equally promising Len Massyn, who’ll join Vincent Tshituka and MJ Pelser in the backrow. “Consistency is the main thing for us; consistency in training, consistency in attitude and consistency in team selection,” said Van Rooyen when he named hi steam on Friday morning.

Lions: EW Viljoen, Rabz Maxwane, Wandisile Simelane, Burger Odendaal (capt), Courtnall Skosan, Jordan Hendrikse, André Warner, Len Massyn, Vincent Tshituka, MJ Pelser, Reinhard Nothnagel, Ruben Schoeman, Carlu Sadie, Jaco Visagie, Sti Sithole.
