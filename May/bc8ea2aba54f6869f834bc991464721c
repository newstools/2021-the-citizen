Thuso Mbedu’s big moment as the first South African actress to lead in an American series has finally come to pass as the first episode of The Underground Railroad premieres today on Amazon Prime. South Africa has been waiting in anticipation to see Mbedu bring her lead role as Cora to life since she announced a year ago on her social media pages she “got the job” and would be cast in the American limited series based on the novel of the same name written by Colson Whitehead. After escaping her Georgia plantation for the rumoured Underground Railroad, Cora discovers no mere metaphor, but an actual railroad full of engineers and conductors and a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the southern soil. Earlier this week, Capitec banked announced a watching party for The Underground Railroad  in support of talented lead actress Mbedu. The event will be hosted by Blood and Water actress Natasha Thahane.
