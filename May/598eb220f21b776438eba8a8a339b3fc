President Cyril Ramaphosa has congratulated Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane on leading the continent’s top football club to victory in the African Super Cup on Friday. Mosimane has now won four CAF competitions, one less than the most successful African, Tunisian Faouzi Benzarti. The annual match between the CAF Champions League and second-tier CAF Confederation Cup winners was watched by a crowd limited to 7,000 in the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium because of coronavirus protocols. The result confirmed the supremacy of Ahly among African clubs with nine victories in the Champions League, seven in the Super Cup, four in the African Cup Winners Cup and one in the Confederation Cup.
