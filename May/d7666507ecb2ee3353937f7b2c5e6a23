A woman from Francistown in Botswana spent 15 minutes fighting off a huge python that attacked their dog at their home on Thursday morning. Tanya Drysdale took to Facebook to share her story after saving her miniature sausage dog. In the post, she said that the 4.6 metre snake had coiled itself around her dog.

But eventually, we got it off and apart from a few broken teeth embedded in her tummy she’s ok.” Picture: Tanya Drysdale / Facebook Snake expert Johan Marais from the African Snakebite Institute identified the snake as a southern African python. He told The Citizen that dogs are good meals for snakes, but bites on humans are rare and in most instances the python bites and releases immediately. “We have had one fatality in South Africa in over 100 years – a youngster looking after cattle in Limpopo was killed in the ’70s. Not from the bite but from constriction,” he said.
