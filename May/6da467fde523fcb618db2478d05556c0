Former South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane will take the witness stand at the judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture on Wednesday morning. Moyane has been accused of working in the interests of state capture by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. In 2016, Moyane laid criminal charges against Gordhan with regard to former commissioner Ivan Pillay’s pension payout. The matter was later withdrawn. The former commissioner has also been accused of the dismantling of certain operations at Sars.

It is alleged that Bain would advise Moyane on Sars operations, who was present in the meetings months before he was “surprisingly” appointed Sars commissioner. Moyane was appointed in September 2014 and eventually fired by President Cyril Ramaphosa on 1 November 2018. Watch the proceedings, courtesy of SABC News, below:
