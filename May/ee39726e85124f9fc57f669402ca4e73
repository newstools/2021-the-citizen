The eldest son of the late regent of the Zulu nation, prince Misuzulu Zulu, made his first public appearance since the death of his mother Mantfombi Shiyiwe Zulu last week and disrupted memorial proceedings. The prince was accompanied by Zulu regiments marching into the marquee where the official memorial of the queen was taking place with prayer in session. The regiments and the prince continued singing until Zulu Prime Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi was forced to come out of the marquee to discipline them.

He is the eldest son of the late regent Queen who was tasked with appointing a new ruler after the death of king Goodwill Zwelithini.
