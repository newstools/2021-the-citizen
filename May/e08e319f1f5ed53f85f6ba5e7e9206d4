National Treasury says disciplinary processes have been started against 79 municipal officials for financial misconduct in 15 municipalities for the 2020/21 financial year. The eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality accounts for the bulk of these, with disciplinary processes instituted against 29 people during the period. These figures came to light when Treasury responded to parliamentary questions from DA MP Cilliers Brink. According to the department the officials include two chief financial officers, seven cashiers and an array of revenue officers, debt collectors, clerks and managers. If the alleged financial misconduct constitutes a financial offence in terms of Section 173 of the Municipal Finance Management Act, charges have to be laid against the person concerned with the South African Police Service (Saps). This is in line with Regulation 16(1) of the Municipal Regulations on Financial Misconduct Procedures and Criminal Proceedings Municipalities must also report in their annual reports all suspensions, disciplinary or criminal proceedings instituted in cases of financial misconduct to different stakeholders. These include the MEC for local government in the province, the national department responsible for local government, the relevant provincial treasury, National Treasury and the Auditor-General.
