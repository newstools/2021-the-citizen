Sam Billings was called into the England squad for the two Test series with New Zealand on Wednesday after Ben Foakes was ruled out with a torn hamstring due to a freak accident. Foakes was due to play his first home Test — all eight previous Test appearances have been abroad — but he tore his left hamstring when he slipped on what is believed to be a sock in the Surrey dressing room on Sunday. The 28-year-old joins talismanic all-rounder Ben Stokes and paceman Jofra Archer in being sidelined for the Kiwi series which gets underway at Lord’s next Wednesday. Archer, out with an elbow problem,  suffered a similar freak accident earlier this year when his fish tank broke while he was cleaning it and a piece of glass lodged in a finger.

Hameed, who has been in impressive form during the 2021 county season, has scored 474 runs at an average of 52.66, last played Test cricket in November 2016. The 24-year-old opener nicknamed ‘baby Boycott’ by team-mates won his three Test caps against India during England’s winter tour of 2016.
