Speaking about the B.1.617 variant, circulating widely in India, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize confirmed on Saturday evening that it has now been detected in South Africa. “The Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) confirmed today that two variants of concern other than the B.1.351 [ known as 501Y.V1] already dominating in South Africa have been detected,” he said. Eleven cases of the B.1.1.7 – first detected in the UK – and four cases of the B.1.617.2 – first detected in India – were confirmed. This means South Africa now has three variants circulating. “In addition the B.1.351 has been sequenced from a patient traveling from Bangladesh. The four cases of B.1.617.2 have been detected in Gauteng (two) and KwaZulu-Natal (two) and all have a history of recent arrival from India. ALSO READ: Where is the Covid-19 third wave? Well, it’s probably closer than you think “All cases have been isolated and managed according to national Covid-19 case management guidelines and contact tracing has been performed in order to limit the spread of this variant. “Of the eleven cases of B.1.1.7, eight were detected in the Western Cape (with two having a history of travel from Bahrain), while one was detected in KZN and two were detected in Gauteng “The B.1.1.7 has been detected in community samples and this therefore suggests that community transmission of B.1.1.7 has already set in,” Mkhize said.

NGS-SA remains vigilant as it continues to support the Department of Health.

It is important to emphasise that variants can develop at anytime in any country so they do not have to be imported,” he added. Mkhize continued to say that there was “no need to panic”. “We are all deeply concerned about the threat of variants of concern and the reports demonstrate that the issue is complicated. Travel restrictions will need be balanced against the scientific realities in order to protect the economy. These findings are urgently being processed by government and announcements pertaining to travel regulations will be made after all appropriate consultations have been undertaken by Cabinet.”  As of Saturday, the cumulative number of detected Covid-19 cases is 1,594,817 with 2,256 new cases identified. 37 more Covid-19 related deaths were reported, with 0 from Eastern Cape, 2 from Free State, 21 from Gauteng, 7 from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), 0 from Limpopo, 0 from Mpumalanga, 0 from North West, 7 from Northern Cape and 0 from Western Cape.
