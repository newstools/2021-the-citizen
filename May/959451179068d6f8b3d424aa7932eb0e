Covid-19 cases have increased by 46% in the past week, as opposed to the preceding seven days, with Covid-19 related deaths increasing by 18.22% in the same period. According to the South African Medical Research Council’s (SAMRC’s) weekly estimated excess deaths, the country had an excess of 158,499 natural deaths from 3 May 2020 to 8 May 2021, with 1,140 excess deaths recorded on 2 May 2021 as compared to 318 confirmed Covid-19 deaths that day. While these figures are worrisome, the resurgence dashboard by the South African Covid-19 Modelling Consortium, which is updated three times a week, shows that the country has not yet reached the third wave threshold, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said.
