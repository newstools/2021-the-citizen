In a recent social media post, South African comedian Trevor Noah announced his return to the stage in a stand up comedy show, joined by American comedy giants Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock. Before Noah made his big move to the US in 2011, his main focus in South Africa was stand up comedy. The comedian and television personality gave South Africa stand up comedy specials such as The Daywalker, Crazy Normal, That’s Racist, and It’s My Culture. Trevor’s fans are pleased to know the comedian will be getting back on stage to do what he does best, making light of the political and cultural issues we face all across the globe.
