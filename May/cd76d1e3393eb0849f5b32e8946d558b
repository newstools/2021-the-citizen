Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe has announced the adjustment of fuel prices based on current local and international factors with effect from Wednesday, 2 June. Based on current local and international factors, the fuel prices for June 2021 have been adjusted as follows: South Africa’s fuel prices are adjusted on a monthly basis, informed by international and local factors, said Mantashe. International factors include the fact that South Africa imports both crude oil and finished products at a price set at the international level, including importation costs. The main reasons for the fuel price adjustments are due to the contribution of international petroleum product prices and the rand/US dollar exchange rate.

This led to higher contributions to the Basic Fuel Price of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 6.28 c/l, 35.52 c/l and 36.67 c/l respectively. “The Rand appreciated, on average, against the US Dollar (from 14.48 to 14.11 Rand per USD) during the period under review when compared to the previous one. This led to lower contributions to the Basic Fuel Prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 17.14 c/l, 16.32 c/l and 15.96 respectively.” Meanwhile, crude oil prices increased from $64.16 to $66.00 per barrel during the period under review. “The oil prices remain at high levels as the season for oil demand is approaching, and the lockdown restrictions are lifted in most European countries and the United States of America (USA).”
