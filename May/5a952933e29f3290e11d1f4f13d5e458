FAIRVIEW TURF RACE 4 NO 1 WORLD RADAR – WIN This four-year-old is one of the best sprinting fillies in the country, unfortunately, she has the soundest issue. Fit and well, she wins – if unsound, she runs unplaced. She has run nine times for six wins and three unplaced runs but she is at her best on the turf and trainer Alan Greeff does not tend to race her unless he feels she can win. Greg Cheyne takes the ride as usual. RACE 8 – BOXED TRIFECTA, HORSES 2, 3 AND 6 Trainer Alan Greeff has a very strong hand in this race and his three runners – Water Spirit, Golden Chance and Step Lively – look set to fight this out. A boxed Trifecta costs just R6 and al they have to do is all finish in the first three – in any order.
