While the dust is yet to settle after heavy criticism of Department of Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu’s move to hire Cuban engineers at a cost of R65 million, it has emerged the Department of Defence has spent more than R1 billion on the services of Cuban service providers. This was revealed by DA shadow minister of defence Kobus Marais, who said the information was acquired through a written reply to a DA parliamentary question. Marais says the government has been outsourcing defence contracts to Cuban companies to maintain and repair its defence equipment under Project Thusano at a cost of more than R1 billion in the past 10 years. Attempts to get hold of the department proved unsuccessful. The party said it would be submitting follow-up questions to ascertain whether there are any steps that the department is taking to ensure that most of its Prime Mission Defence Equipment repair and maintenance budget is spent locally.
