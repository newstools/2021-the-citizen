South African trail running rivals turned team-mates Christiaan Greyling and AJ Calitz have “climbed” their way into the Guinness World Records. The duo has broken the record for running – or rather climbing – a vertical distance on foot in 19 hours and 52 minutes. They achieved their feat on Table Mountain’s Platteklip Gorge last Monday. Because of the Covid-19 curfew Greyling and Calitz only had 20 hours to complete their goal of 14 ascents of Platteklip Gorge and they succeeded in making 14 ascents, reaching a height of 19,376 metres, in 19 hours and 52 minutes. Climbing up Platteklip Gorge takes some doing.

We are broken, but the effort was worth it.” Trail runner Christiaan Greyling.

Greyling and Calitz’s aim was to raise awareness for Edunova, a non-profit company focused on the effective use of technology in disadvantaged schools throughout South Africa.
