VAAL CLASSIC RACE 1 SWINGER No 5 Abalus! and No 6 Aurora Light Of the runners who have raced, Abalus! looks to have them stone cold on form. However, there is a lot of talk for Paul Peter-trained first-timer Aurora Light. As a result, the Swinger looks the way to go. It won’t pay much but it does look a good bet. RACE 6 NO 5 BAROMETER – EACH-WAY This is not an easy race but the Corne Spies runner goes well for jockey Chase Maujean who is back aboard today. He is around 8-1 and that does look good value.
