The Springboks and British & Irish Lions will play for a trophy when they meet in a three-Test series later this year. SA Rugby posted on its official website that it will be the “first perpetual trophy in the history of the British & Irish Lions”.  The rugby governing body said it took more than 150 hours to make the trophy, which was hand-crafted by Thomas Lyte – the official silverware supplier to the British & Irish Lions – and stands 60cm tall and weighs 6.5kg.

The trophy will be presented to the winner of the series and go into a trophy cabinet in either the northern or southern hemisphere, before reappearing in 2025 when the British & Irish Lions continue their storied history with a series in Australia. The Lions squad will be named at 1pm on Thursday, with the tour scheduled between 3 July and 7 August.
