They will allow him to finish the season at AmaZulu before they make an official move,” said the source. McCarthy was said to have been top of Safa’s list as they were searching for a new Bafana coach but couldn’t agree on his demands. Usuthu president, Sandile Zungu was angry that Safa had gone behind their backs and spoke to Rob Moore about the issue. Meanwhile, as reported earlier, four players are set to be released at AmaZulu FC at the end of the season with the technical team said to have alerted the club’s management that they are not in their plans.
