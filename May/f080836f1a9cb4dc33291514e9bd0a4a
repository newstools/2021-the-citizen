That’s right, The B-WELL Mayonnaise range is hot and happening, as more people hear about it, more are drawn to try it. While the B-WELL Mayonnaise range differs in flavour and texture, they all share a strong common trait. They are packed with healthful goodness, are completely plant-based and are one of the few food brands endorsed by the Heart and Stroke Foundation South Africa. This is because each Mayo is packed with Omega-3, is low in saturated fat, low in sodium and naturally cholesterol-free. Oh yeah… nothing beats a healthy heart. This is exceptionally beneficial for those who are living with, or who are at risk of cardiac disease and complications. That’s right, The B-WELL Range is completely inclusive, which means no one is left out, B-WELL Mayo is even gluten-free. B-WELL Mayonnaise is created without any eggs and dairy- and it is made in a factory that practises waste-free food practises as all leftover canola seed material is created into animal feed. The B-WELL factory is found in the heart of Swellendam. You can follow the yellow brick road, I mean fields of flowers that spread along the highway to the local and lekker source of NON-GMO canola oil that is used to create the B-WELL Mayonnaise oil. Made with love, made local by local.
