Based on the trailer, this season of Kelly’s reality TV show will focus on Kelly’s love life and her getting back into the dating scene, even though she says: “I am not in a relationship, I am playing with someone”, as well as the return of her mother Ntombi Khumalo.  When talking about Kelly’s reality TV to Candice Fangueiro, Showmax’s head of content, she said: “Fans have been asking for Season 2 of Life With Kelly Khumalo since it first aired last August, so we’re delighted to be able to deliver it nine months later.” “Life With Kelly Khumalo became the fastest Showmax Original to top 1 million views, so renewing the series was an easy decision to make.” The executive producer of the reality TV show, Legend Manqele, said: “With the new season, Kelly is going through a healing process from all she encountered in Season 1. “Kelly is trying to take in everything at her own pace. But in the same breath, the answers she was seeking have now opened up more questions that need answering, which not only affect her but also her kids in the long run.”
