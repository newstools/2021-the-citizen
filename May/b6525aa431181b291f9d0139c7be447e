 Horseplayers who take sizeable bets with TAB and TABgold need not worry about extraordinarily large Win, Place, Swinger and Quinella wagers significantly reducing payouts on this Saturday’s Daily News 2000 race meeting at Greyville. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which boasts the biggest tote pools in the world, has classified the race meeting as a World Pool event and all Win, Place, Swinger and Quinella bets on Races 2 to 9 will be commingled into Hong Kong pools. Commingled pools on each of the four-bet types are possibly set to run into tens of millions of rands each. As an added bonus for South African punters, an R1-million carryover into the Pick 6 pool means that the expected pool total could exceed R5-million. Two of South Africa’s major races for three-year-olds, both over 2000m, top the programme. Wilgerbosdrift SA Triple Tiara heroine War of Athena is 9-10 favourite for the Woolavington 2000 for fillies. Linebacker, winner of the Grade 1 Cape Derby this year and more recently the WSB KZN Guineas, is 18-10 favourite for the males’ equivalent, the Daily News 2000. Kommetdieding, hampered when third behind Linebacker in the Guineas, is fractionally longer in the ante-post betting at 2-1.
