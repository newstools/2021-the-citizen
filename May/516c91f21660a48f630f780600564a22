Gordhan’s spokesperson, Richard Mantu, warned the public to ignore the reports, which are “meant to cause mistrust and confusion in the media environment.” Mantu said the minister continues to be engaged in matters of government to ensure that state-owned entities are stabilised and play a critical role in the economic recovery of the country. Gordhan said: “I’m well and working hard for the country. This is clearly created by the corrupt and desperate elements in South Africa who wish to go on stealing, neglect the poor and abuse public resources.” Who has seen Pravin Gordhan lately ????
