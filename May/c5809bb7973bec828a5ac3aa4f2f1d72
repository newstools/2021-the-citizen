Only 15 people out of almost 60,000 who attended nine pilot events for mass gatherings have since tested positive for coronavirus, British health officials said Friday. The government allowed limited crowds at the events — including two FA Cup games, the World Snooker Championship and the Brit Awards — over recent weeks to assess their impact on Covid-19 transmission. The country has since March been gradually easing its strict lockdown, with 22,000 football fans permitted inside Wembley Stadium last weekend for the FA Cup final.

The United Kingdom has been one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe by the pandemic, but has been able to ease lockdown measures in part thanks to a highly successful vaccination campaign. The government is hoping to lift remaining restrictions on June 21, but doubts have emerged after numerous spikes in the Indian variant of the virus across the country. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to make an announcement on the next stage of the relaxations next week.
