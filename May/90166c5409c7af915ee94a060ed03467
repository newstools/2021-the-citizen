An unnecessary send-off of Njabulo Blom who committed needless fouls, an unlucky handball inside their own half were enough to leave Kaizer Chiefs coach, Gavin Hunt confused after it all led their 2-1 loss to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on Tuesday.

But uhm, we made mistakes and it’s inexcusable to make mistakes like that… we just battle on,” said Hunt afterwards. On the penalty, which was conceded right at the death, and Thabo Mnyamane’s spot kick being the last action of the match, Hunt was left with a bitter taste. Mnyamane converted the spot kick to make it 2-1 to the home side, sending Amakhosi back to Naturena empty handed. “Same player (for the conceded penalty). It certainly gets your backs against the wall, it doesn’t help at all, but ja, it is what it is. “Now with four games left, we certainly have to win all four and take it from there. It was an even game until that red card, and then the defending…” Amakhosi will next be in action on Tuesday when they host Soweto neighbours, Swallows FC, and Hunt was at least happy with the little break they will get before then. “This is the longest break we will have now with the seven days, so we will have a few days (of rest) after what we’ve been through since December. We will try and regroup and then go again.”
