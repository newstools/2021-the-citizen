The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has warned of two successive cold fronts expected to move in over the Western Cape from Thursday. The cold fronts will result in rainy, cold and windy conditions. “A cold front is set to move in over the southwestern Cape during Thursday morning causing widespread showers and rain, especially over the western parts of the Western Cape, spreading over the eastern parts of the Western Cape, the southern parts of the Northern Cape and western parts of the Eastern Cape during the afternoon and evening,” SAWS said. Strong sustained winds may be experienced over the southern high ground of the Northern Cape, the interior of the Western Cape and the interior of the Eastern Cape, it said. This will result in difficult driving conditions, especially for high-sided vehicles. A secondary cold front will make landfall on Friday, causing rainfall and light snowfall to persist over the Western Cape.
