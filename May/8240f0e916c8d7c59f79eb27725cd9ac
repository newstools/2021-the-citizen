The department released a statement on Tuesday evening confirming the sacking of the teacher. “We can confirm that the disciplinary process which was instituted upon finding out about the video took place on Monday 24 May 2021 and has been concluded with the verdict being the immediate dismissal of the Grade R practitioner,” reads the statement.     It said that the teacher was served with the outcomes of the disciplinary on Tuesday.

The GDE shortly after the video had emerged said on Twitter that it had been made aware of the complaint. “We are attending to this matter, educator precautionary transferred to the District Office, DC Hearing scheduled for Monday, 24 May 2021. Counselling is provided to the child and family,” the department’s spokesperson Steve Mabona wrote on Twitter.
