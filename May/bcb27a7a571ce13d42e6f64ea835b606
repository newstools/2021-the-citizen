Eskom has announced that load shedding will return from today at 5pm, due to shortage of generation capacity. In a statement just before at 4.30pm, the power utility said: “Regrettably, Eskom will implement Stage 1 loadshedding starting at 17:00 this afternoon, until 22:00 tonight. “This loadshedding is required as a result of a shortage in generation capacity due to breakdowns and delays in returning generator units to service. “Eskom teams are working to return more generators to service as soon as possible. Should the generators not return as expected, further load shedding might be required during the week.” ALSO READ: Eskom’s limitations restrict economic recovery, says expert Earlier on Wednesday, the power utility thanked South Africans for helping to avoid load shedding on Tuesday evening and appealed to the public to continue to use electricity sparingly.
