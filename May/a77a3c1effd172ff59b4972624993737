The postponement of a case against Kaizer Gwebu, the man accused of torching the settlement of protesting Lily Mine families outside the mine, has left political party Action SA and the families in dismay. The party said that it will be filing a complaint on behalf of the families with the Magistrates’ Commission and the Department of Justice and Correctional Services Ministry against the presiding officer handling the matter. The matter was postposed to 4 June. Gwebu has been previously convicted for murder and armed robbery. He is currently is out on bail, following his arrest in connection to the current case of arson. He was previously sentenced to 30 years and released on parole in 2013. Our legal team will be filing a complaint on behalf of the families, with the Magistrates Commission and the Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services regarding the presiding officer’s handling of this matter.#JusticeForLilyMine — ActionSA (@Action4SA) May 28, 2021  Action SA said that it suspects foul play in the matter, adding that the party was not surprised that no further arrests had been made in the case, as it it believes Gwebu was not working alone.
