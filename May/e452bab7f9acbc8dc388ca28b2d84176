With the second generation Duster Oroch earmarked for unveiling next year in addition to coming to South Africa, Renault, despite dropping the Nissan Navara-based Alaskan in Europe, has not given up on the bakkie market with its latest addition squarely marketed as a workhorse. Only destined for some European markets, the new Express Pick-up is the work of Italian firm Focaccia Automotive Group and based on the new Kangoo with both replacing the van and pick-up versions of the Dacia Dokker on the Old Continent. RELATED: South Africa bound next generation Renault Duster Oroch being developed A similar outsourcing exercise to the Romanian market only Dacia Duster Pick-up made by Romturingia, the Express retains the front-end look of the Kangoo but with the rear completely  redesigned from the B-pillar back.

While likely to be similar to basic versions of the Kangoo, no images of the interior were revealed. Up front, the Express comes powered by a choice of two engines shared with the Kangoo; the 74 kW 1.3-litre turbo-petrol and the 1.5 Blue dCi in two states of tune; 55 kW and 70 kW. Being a commercial vehicle, the Express foregoes an automatic gearbox with the sole option being a six-speed manual across all models. For now, no pricing details are known but don’t expect the Express to land in South African any time soon. Additional information from diariomotor.com
