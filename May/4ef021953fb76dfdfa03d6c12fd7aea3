The community of Clare Estate, Durban has been left in shock following the brutal murder of a woman, allegedly by her own son on Thursday last week. According to Rising Sun Overport, Uveer Jaganath, 20, allegedly stabbed his mother, Jessica Jaganath, 44, more than 26 times with a kitchen knife in their home in Clare Estate. It was said in his bail application that Jaganath had blacked out and could not remember the killing of his mother. Uveer was denied bail by the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. The court case was adjourned to July 14.
