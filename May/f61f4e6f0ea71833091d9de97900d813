Having made its debut just over two years ago, Peugeot has finally announced the price and spec details of the all-new second generation 208. Arriving months after Stellantis stablemate Opel’s new Corsa, which rides on the same EMP1 platform, the aggressively styled new 208 measures 4,500mm in overall length with its wheelbase coming to 2540mm, height to 1,430mm and width to 1,745mm. Claimed boot space is 311 litres or 1,106 litres with the rear seats down. RELATED: New Opel Corsa on rocky road to relive glory days Tipping the scales at 30kg lighter than its predecessor, the 208, like the Corsa, touches down powered by two versions of the familiar 1.2 litre PureTech three-cylinder petrol engine; the normally aspirated unit that produces 55kW/118Nm and the turbo variant in two states of tune; 74kW/205Nm and 96kW/230Nm. Limited to the entry-level Active model, the free-breathing 1.2 is paired to a five-speed manual gearbox with the next step-up Allure offering a six-speed manual as the sole option on the 74kW turbo. Opt for the 96kW unit though, and the manual is replaced by a six-speed automatic which comes standard on the range-topping GT. Rear is a world away from the previous 208. Performance-wise, the Active will get from 0-100km/h in 14.9 seconds and reach a top speed of 171km/h, while the Allure manual will dispatch the benchmark sprint in 9.9 seconds before topping out at 188km/h. Equipped with the automatic box and plus the additional 22kW/25Nm, both the Allure and GT will sprint from 0-100km/h in 8.8 seconds before reaching a V-max of 198km/h. Claimed fuel consumption is 5.8 L/100 km for the Active and Allure manual with the automatic Allure and GT consuming unleaded at a rate of 6.3 L/100 km. On the specification front, the Active rides on 15 inch steel wheels in addition to the following: Adding to these, the Allure swaps the steelies for 16 inch alloys while also receiving a digital instrument cluster and a second USB port. Also included are: The interior is a further step up from the old 208. As the range’s flagship, the GT boasts model-specific 17 inch alloy wheels, gloss black accents and the option of a panoramic glass roof. Standard though is: Standard across the four model line-up is a five-year/100,000km warranty as well as a three-year/60,000km service plan. 208 1.2 Active – R289,900 208 1.2T Allure – R349,900 208 1.2T Allure AT – R379,900 208 1.2T GT AT – R424,900
