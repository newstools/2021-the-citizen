Springbok No 8 Duane Vermeulen is back in the Bulls team for the Pretoria-based side’s second round Rainbow Cup SA game against the Stormers in Cape Town on Saturday. Vermeulen is back after sitting out last week’s round one match against the Sharks and he’ll also take over the captaincy of the side. He takes the place at the back of the scrum of fellow Springbok Nizaam Carr, who drops to the bench. The only other change in the forwards is at lock where Walt Steenkamp comes in for Janko Swanepoel.

Bulls: David Kriel, Madosh Tambwe, Marco Jansen van Vuren, Cornal Hendricks, Stravino Jacobs, Morné Steyn, Embrose Papier, Duane Vermeulen (capt), Elrigh Louw, Marco van Staden, Ruan Nortje, Walt Steenkamp, Mornay Smith, Johan Grobbelaar, Gerhard Steenekamp. Bench: Schalk Erasmus, Lizo Gqoboka, Jacques van Rooyen, Janko Swanepoel, Nizaam Carr, Zak Burger, Chris Smith, James Verity-Amm, Jan-Hendrik Wessels, Reinhardt Ludwig, Arno Botha, Keagan Johannes, Janco Uys
