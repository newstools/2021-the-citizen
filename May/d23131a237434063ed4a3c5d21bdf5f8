Cabinet has approved another extension of the national state of disaster on Covid-19 until 15 June 2021. This follows a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday which discussed various issues, including the country’s Covid-19 response and vaccine rollout programme. The current national state of disaster was meant to expire on 15 May 2021, after it was extended in April. “The extension is in terms of Section 27(5)(c) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act 57 of 2002). The extension considers the need to continue augmenting the existing legislation and contingency arrangements undertaken by organs of state to mitigate against the impact of the disaster on lives and livelihoods,” Cabinet said in a statement on Thursday.

On Wednesday, new cases nationally increased by 2,759, pushing the total to 1,602,031 while 1,548 new cases were recorded on Tuesday. Five provinces – Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, North West and Western Cape – are also showing sustained increases.
