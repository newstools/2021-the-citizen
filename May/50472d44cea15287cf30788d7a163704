And before that, he publicly apologised to his wife following a leaked audio with sexual connotations. He used a Sunday church service to “humble” himself before his wife and congregation with an apology. “I’m repeating what I said three years ago to my wife; I have sinned against heaven and I have sinned against you [wife]. “Maybe I’m no longer worthy to be called your husband, with all humility, I’m repeating words I said three years ago,  I have sinned, please find it in your heart to forgive me,” said Makamu to his wife, who walked up to the pulpit to hug her husband.
