It gets frustrating for a player when you are coming to the end of your contract and the management of the club is not saying anything. “Some of the guys are currently in negotiations with the management over their future at the club. I know Grant Kekana is in discussions with the management and they are at the final stages from what I’ve been hearing here and there. So, from what I’ve noticed and think, it doesn’t look like he will be staying at the team,” said the source.
