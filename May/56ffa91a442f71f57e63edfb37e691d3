CITIZEN BETS TURFFONTEIN RACE 3 – SWINGER NO 1 I DREAM AND GENIE AND NO 8 VOLTRON This is another case of a Swinger that won’t pay big money but looks as close to a “racing certainty” as one can find. Take it as many times as you can afford. RACE 7 NO 7 QUERARI FERRARI – EACH-WAY Querari Ferrari looked as if she was heading for the top but was then sold and changed trainers. She didn’t achieve the expected heights with her new trainers, but she is now back with Erico Verdonese, who was her original trainer. She is starting to regain the old form and has won her only race at this track. At 7-1 looks a nice each-way bet.
