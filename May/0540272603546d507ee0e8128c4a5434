Leopards coach Lehlohonolo Seema has vowed that his charges will play their last games of the as Cup finals in their quest to escape relegation. “All our remaining games are like a cup final now. We have five games left, meaning there are still 15 points to fight for, so we must now plan for each game as it comes,” said Seema. “We don’t have a plan, we just need to take it one game at a time and play to win. That is all that we are targeting. We haven’t moved on the log. But at least we are closing the gap, so, for us it is about one game at a time, nothing else.”
