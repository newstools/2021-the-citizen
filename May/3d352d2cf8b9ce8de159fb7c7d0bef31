 British singer and songwriter Seal told news outlets that he and his ex-wife Heidi Klum never worked as a team when it came to co-parenting. While married, the couple had four children, Leni, 17, Henry, 15, Johan, 14, and Lou, 11. The two were married for nine years from 2005 to 2014, although they separated in 2012. He said co-parenting healthily was possible if both parents worked together. He then admitted the co-parenting relationship between himself and Heidi was not a good one. Speaking to US Weekly Magazine, Seal said co-parenting “can be challenging. It requires teamwork. If you are not a team then it can all fall to pieces.” ALSO SEE: What challenges do co-parents go through?
