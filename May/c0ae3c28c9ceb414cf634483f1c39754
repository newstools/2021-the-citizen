The government’s proposal will that could ban South Africans from getting gun licences for the purpose of self-defence has received criticism. The Draft Firearms Control Amendment Bill was released on Friday night, and gives the public until July to submit their comments in writing. The move has been criticised by Girls on Fire, an organisation that helps women get licences for firearms. The government’s move will promote gender-based violence, argued the organisation.

If these proposed changes are adopted, it will be a huge step back for women’s empowerment in South Africa. It will take us back to before our political emancipation, where we had no rights at all, especially the right to our implicit means to protect the right to life.” ALSO READ: Police budget: VIP protection more important than fighting corruption The move comes after the 2021-2022 budget for VIP protection increased to R1.7 billion, with the expenditure for protection and security services totalling R3.23 billion. Tabling his budget vote before Parliament last week, Police Minister Bheki Cele cut the country’s visible policing sector’s budget by almost R4 billion, while crime intelligence’s budget was cut by R89 million. “Now you suggest, through these proposed amendments, that our means to protect ourselves will be lost. This while you sit safely behind your high walls with well-funded armed guards,” said Mmekwa. Additional reporting by Rorisang Kgosana
