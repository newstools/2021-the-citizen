Ismael Coovadia dies of Covid-19: He was ‘a dedicated and selfless cadre’ – ANC The ANC has paid homage to former Israel ambassador, Ismael Coovadia, who died of Covid-19 on Sunday. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe described Coovadia as a “dedicated and selfless cadre”. “This stalwart and veteran of our movement was a principled fighter for freedom and justice. He will be remembered for rejecting a gift of 18 trees planted in his honour by the Israeli regime, on the basis that the trees were planted on occupied Palestinian land.

A strong opponent of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, he once referred to Israel’s actions as a “replication” of apartheid. Additional reporting by News24 Wire
