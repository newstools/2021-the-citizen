Stormers loose-forward Johan du Toit, younger brother of Springbok star Pieter-Steph, has been named as captain of the Invitational side for Saturdayâ€™s Toyota Challenge against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein. The Invitational side, which is made up mainly of fringe players from the Rainbow Cup SA teams, is coached by former Springbok backline coach Ricardo Loubscher and current Bok scrum coach Daan Human. The team is further supplemented by a number of Varsity Cup stars and locals from the Cheetahs. The selected players gathered in Bloemfontein on Wednesday and Thursday and worked with Loubscher, a former Springbok assistant coach, and Human, who is currently involved on the Springbok management. The aim of this game is to give quality players on the fringes of their respective SA franchise teams game time, while the Cheetahs get to prepare against top opposition for the forthcoming Currie Cup.
