Sharks coach Sean Everitt has made just one change to his team for Saturday’s Rainbow Cup SA clash against the Bulls in Pretoria. Scrumhalf Jaden Hendrikse returns to the starting team in place of Grant Williams, with Sanele Nohamba filling a spot on the bench. Williams misses out completely this week. It is the first change to the matchday 23 since the start of the competition. The Sharks played their second match last week with the same team that did duty in round one. The Sharks and Bulls are both unbeaten in the competition. The last time they met in a competitive match it was the Bulls who came away with the spoils, pipping the Sharks in the Currie Cup final at Loftus Versfeld.
