Nissan has officially opened order books for the locally built Navara that will become available from next month. In addition to announcing pricing, the heavily updated Navara, which debuted last year and is now assembled at the automaker’s Rosslyn Plant outside Pretoria, sees the return of not only a petrol engine for the first time since the previous generation’s 4.0-litre V6, but a single cab model for the very first time. Single cab Navara debuts with the new XE trim level A comprehensive line-up spanning 17 models over single and double cab bodystyles, the Navara retains the previous model’s upper SE and LE trim levels, but introduces three new grades; the entry-level XE, SE Plus and the range-topping Pro-4X that originated in the United States and is aimed at the Ford Ranger Wildtrak and Toyota Hilux Legend RS. As befitting its designation, the XE serves as a workhorse nomenclature with its availability being limited to the single cab. In terms of specification, it features as standard: Interior of the Navara SE Upgrading to the SE, which serves as the starting point of the double cab range once again, nets the following: Navara SE Plus Upping the ante, the SE Plus, which is exclusive to the double cab, swaps the steel wheels for 17-inch alloys while also receiving: Navara LE As before, the top-spec LE comes loaded and apart from swapping the SE Plus’ 17-inch alloys for chrome 18-inche wheels, boasts the following: Interior of the Navara Pro-4X Sitting at the top of the range, the Pro-4X builds on the LE and is only available as a double cab. Aside from model specific 17-inch alloy wheels, it gets: Up front, and for the first time since the introduction of the current D23 Navara, a choice of engines are offered with the mentioned petrol being joined by a single turbodiesel. Producing 118kW/233Nm, the petrol displaces 2.5-litres is paired exclusively to a six-speed manual gearbox with drive only going to the rear wheels. In the biggest surprise yet, Nissan has reverted back to 2.5-litres for the diesel with the previous 2.3-litre single and twin-turbo units making way for a single blowing version of the engine that served as the flagship in the D40 Navara until the arrival of the 3.0-litre V9X. Available in two states of tune, the engine produces 120kW/403Nm in the XE, SE and SE Plus, while matching the twin-turbo 2.3’s 140kW/450Nm in the LE and Pro-4X. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the former trio with a seven-speed automatic optional but only on the two-wheel-drive models. On the LE, the manual is only offered on the four-wheel-drive model with the self-shifter being otherwise standard. As before, buyers have the option of two-or-four-wheel-drive. Regardless of the bodystyle, all Navara models come standard with a six year/150 000 km warranty as well as a six year/90 000 km service plan.
