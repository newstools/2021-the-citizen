Bentley has added a fourth model to the Bentayga line-up in the shape of the new Bentayga S that slots-in above the standard V8 but below the W12 powered Speed. Arriving after the addition of the plug-in hybrid model in January, the S mainly rates as a cosmetic upgrade with the exterior boasting black accents, a new and larger rear spoiler, a gloss black lower bumper and dark tinted head-and-taillights, black oval exhaust outlet and black mirror caps. New rear spoiler one of the biggest exterior highlights of the S. Bespoke to the S are the newly designed 22-inch alloy wheels available in three finishes; the standard silver, optional polished black and also from the options list, gloss black with S badges completing the transformation.

Rounding the changes off are S embroidered headrests and a so-called flute stitch pattern on the seats themselves. Fitted as standard with the otherwise optional all-terrain package made up of four modes; Dirt/Gravel, Sand, Snow/Wet Grass and Mud/Trail, the Bentayga S is motivated by the same engine as the V8 namely the twin-turbo 4.0-litre bent-eight that produces 405kW/770Nm. Interior Hooked to an eight-speed automatic gearbox with the 48-volt Bentley Dynamic Ride system standard, the S will get from 0-100 km/h in 4.5 seconds and top out at 290 km/h. Compared to the standard V8 though, the S boasts a retuned air suspension, recalibrated Torque Vectoring system and a sports exhaust system. No details have been released but expect availability possibility from later or towards the end of this year.
