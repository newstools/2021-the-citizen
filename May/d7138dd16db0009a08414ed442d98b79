There will be top-flight domestic rugby in South Africa this weekend as the Free State Cheetahs, looking to quickly get up to speed for the Currie Cup, will be taking on a Toyota Invitational XV in Bloemfontein on Saturday. The match, starting at 4pm, will be the first the Cheetahs have played since March 28 when they hammered the Eastern Province Elephants 71-12 in the Preparation Series, having been excluded from the Rainbow Cup which is on a bye week in South Africa. With the Currie Cup set to get underway on June 19, the Free Staters need some competitive action as they look to regain the trophy they won in 2019. The Invitational XV will be made up of players who are on the fringes of their Rainbow Cup franchises and will be coached by Ricardo Loubscher and Daan Human, who are both part of the Springbok management.
