In addition to healthcare workers, the government on Monday started vaccinating those over 60 years of age, essential workers, people in congregate settings and those over 18 years old with comorbidities. While some have celebrated the progress, the EFF “seriously” doubts the impact the “so-called” phase 2 will have on the fight against the virus. “This concern stems from the spectacular failure of the government’s vaccination attempts to date. It is now common cause that less than 600,000 healthcare workers had been vaccinated by 17 May. This is one of many deadly mishaps in the manner the department has handled the Covid pandemic. These mistakes are deadly because they lead to the deaths of many,” the EFF said in a statement. Additional reporting by Vhahangwele Nemakonde
