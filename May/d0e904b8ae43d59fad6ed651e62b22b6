The new storage conditions are expected to help the government and health sector administer the vaccines faster, and reportedly also avoid vaccines going to waste.

The Pfizer vaccine has posed a major challenge in distribution because of its extreme cold storage requirements, which calls for it being stored at -70 degrees celsius. But in February, Pfizer Inc. and  and BioNTech submitted new data to the U.S. FDA showing that their  their vaccine remained stable when stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F), which are temperatures more commonly found in pharmaceutical freezers and refrigerators.

Sahpra’s approved changes extends the approved storage period of the unopened thawed vaccine vial at -2 to -8 degrees from five days to a month (31 days). This means that one can store the vials in a vaccine fridge thawing for up to a month. These changes take immediate effect and are applicable to all unopened vials, including vials from those batches which have already been distributed.
