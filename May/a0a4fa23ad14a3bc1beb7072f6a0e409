Two people were killed and several wounded in a shooting in the US city of Minneapolis late Friday, police said. Local law enforcement said one man was left in a critical condition following the attack in the downtown area of the city, which was where George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in May 2020. Minneapolis Police tweeted there were ten victims in total, five of whom were male and five female.
