She has been open in the past about her struggles in the fashion industry and discrimination. In 2020 she was outspoken about the racism she experienced in her career for over 30 years, a topic she has never shied away from. In a video she posted, wearing a T-shirt with the legend “Phenomenally Black”, Campbell said the “time has come to build a more equitable industry with a good form of checks and balances”. The lessons of the Black Lives Matter movement must also be applied to fashion, she said. “This is a conversation that is starting now and will last as long as is needed. “It is up to us and you to start enforcing the inclusion of the multitude of identities that compose our countries,” she added.
