Los Angeles – A girl opened fire at a school in the northwestern US state of Idaho on Thursday, injuring three people before being disarmed by a teacher, police said. The unnamed student at Rigby Middle School near Idaho Falls was in the sixth grade, meaning she would likely be aged 11 or 12.

Injuries suffered by two students and one staff member are not thought to be life-threatening, he said. “During the shooting a teacher disarmed the student, and detained her until law enforcement took her into custody,” added Anderson at a press conference. The shooting is being investigated by the FBI as well as local law enforcement.
