Heavy rains, high winds and hail hit greater Cape Town causing flooding and running water in the streets on Wednesday, following a cold front alert from the South African Weather Service (Saws). The Western Cape Disaster Management Centre (WCDMC) said they had geared up for a major storm as a cold front hit the province and surrounding areas. Earlier this week, Saws warned of heavy rain and flooding over the Cape Metropole, Overberg and southwestern Cape Winelands from Wednesday evening to Friday morning. MEC for local government, environmental affairs and development planning, Anton Bredell, said evacuations were being done in homes that had been affected. “People being evacuated from their homes are being housed at the Struisbaai Caravan Park and Struisbaai Community Hall,” he said. “The Cape Agulhas Municipality joint operational centre has been activated for all disaster management matters.” #CapeStorm Struisbaai pic.twitter.com/6ERYgLL055 — Rob Beezy (@TrafficSA) May 5, 2021  ALSO READ: Hold on to your hats!
