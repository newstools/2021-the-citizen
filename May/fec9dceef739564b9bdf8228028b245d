Citizens over the age of 60 and other vulnerable groups will be able to get their Covid-19 vaccinations from Monday, and the Gauteng department of health has published a list of accredited facilities where the phase 1 b and phase 2 vaccine rollout will take place. Despite the next phase in vaccine rollouts,  kicking off this week, a number of healthcare workers are yet to get their jabs, which means they will also be accommodated under phase 1 b. Those who qualify to receive the vaccine have been warned not to simply pitch up at vaccination sites, but are requested to register on government’s  Electronic Vaccination Data System (EVDS). Thereafter they will receive a confirmation SMS telling them where and when to report for their jabs.
