KykNET has released a statement on its Facebook page announcing the death of beloved Binnelanders star, Ben Kruger. The actor, writer and producer passed away at the age of 64 due to Covid-19 complications. The statement reads: “It is with great sadness that the Binnelanders family were informed of the sudden passing of Ben Kruger, ‘n beloved member of our cast.”  “We will remember him for his professionalism, his dignity, sense of humour, and of course, his natural ability to make an incredible potjiekos! We will miss Ben dearly.” Ben was known for his role as Okkie Ferreira in the Afrikaans soap Binnelanders, and also for his role as Christo de Wet, a teacher in Skooldae. M-Net director Karen Meiring said that because episodes of the soap are recorded about three months before they are broadcast, Ben will still be seen as Okkie on Binnelanders for some time. Here are some Twitter posts from Kruger’s fans who have sent tributes to the late actor and warm regards to his loved ones: @toksvdl So sad met afsterwe van Ben Kruger weens covid.
