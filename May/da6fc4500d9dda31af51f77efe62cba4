Kelly Khumalo’s firstborn child Christian Khumalo is almost a teenager. Yesterday, Christian turned 11 years old and Kelly took to social media to share a heartfelt message for him. The songstress called Christian “my heart in a human form”. This message comes on the eve of the second season of Kelly’s reality show, Life With Kelly Khumalo. In this season, Kelly takes viewers on a journey of finding love and opening herself up to receiving love.   A post shared by The Voice Of Africa (@kellykhumaloza)  Kelly’s family-centred series features both Thingo and Christaan. In the show trailer, Kelly asks Christian about a number on his phone. Kelly seems to have her hands full with some behavioral challenges from Christian, and shares some of them in the show.

Maybe season two of Life with Kelly Khumalo will shed some light.
