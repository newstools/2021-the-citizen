South Africa’s Natasha Joubert is expected to make the country proud, and hopefully make it an SA double, when she competes in the Miss Universe pageant in the US on Sunday night. Due to the time difference, South Africans will have to stay up way past bedtime to see her compete, as it is happening between 02h00 to 05h00 on Monday morning SA time. The show will be broadcast live on 1 Magic (DStv Channel 103) and rebroadcast on Monday at 21h30 on the same channel.
