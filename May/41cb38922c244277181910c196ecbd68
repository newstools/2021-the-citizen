I also love the Victorian era – I’m a historical-romance person at heart, so to combine those elements of that era into my wedding gown was a dream come true and it says a lot about the person I am.” The groom wore two outfits for the special occasion, both designed by Prince Bespokes. He  paired his stylish wedding suits with a pair of Louis Vuitton shoes. Kgolo’s wedding shoes.
