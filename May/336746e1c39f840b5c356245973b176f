President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation at 7pm tonight on the government’s Covid-19 response. The President’s address follows meetings in recent days of the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC), the President’s Coordinating Council (PCC) and Cabinet. Speculation is rife that the NCCC, which met last Tuesday, could move the country to a higher lockdown level. There are fears the NCCC could impose restrictions on alcohol sales, gatherings and a change to the national curfew. South Africa is currently under lockdown level 1.
