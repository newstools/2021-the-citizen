Toddlerhood is one of the most fascinating stages of a child’s development. The baby you have been watching grow right in front of your eyes is developing a personality and a vocabulary. This combination can either be a source of entertainment, or your worst nightmare (in a funny way). When Tia Mokoka tweeted “normalise arguing with toddlers”, she quickly went viral as South African parents shared why they choose not to. Normalize arguing with toddlers. — Cup.of.Tia (@Tia_Mokoka) May 18, 2021  you can never win trust me, my boy once said “it’s just that you don’t understand english” i can’t teach him anything also because i am not a teacher hai I gave up a long time ago ???????????? — Emily Sithole (@EmilySithole3) May 18, 2021  Aunts and uncles on the thread quickly commented how arguing with children is entertaining for them. I argue with my nephews and nieces until their parents intervene. I don’t back down . Lapho I’m prepared to throw a few a punches if the need arises ???????????? — BundusGirl ????

(@ItsBi_NotBee) May 18, 2021  Conversations about children’s logic started surfacing, others arguing that it is a waste of time because their reasoning capacity is not the best. To provide an example, @Hadassah shared a video of a young boy who wants to marry his mother. His mom kept trying to reason with him, to no avail.

It seems like traditional parenting and the usual childbirth lies are not working for the newer generation. How she tried to laugh the nonsense off????.
