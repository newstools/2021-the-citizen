Ntuthuko Shoba, the alleged mastermind behind the brutal murder of Tshegofatso Pule was on Friday denied his second bid for bail by the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court. Shoba was first denied bail by the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court in March. Shoba is facing charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and defeating the ends of justice for his alleged role in the murder of 28-year-old Pule. The 32 year old was charged with Pule’s murder in February after Muzikayise Malephane pleaded guilty to the murder and turned state witness. Malephane claimed he was hired by Shoba to kill Pule and make it look like suicide.
