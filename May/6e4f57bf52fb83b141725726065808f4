The publication reported that he had a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and had worked as a flight attendant for more than 20 years. Boshoga often posted photographs of his travels and of his art on his social media profiles, and his death left friends bereft. Saddened to here of the passing of Aubrey Boshoga. Such a kind soul. I met him when we did this photo shoot for @Previdar . He loved and was a huge collector of vintage suitcases. May his murderer be brought to justice. EWN spoke to Boshoga’s sister Josephine who said CCTV footage showed a car dropping her brother’s body outside his yard. Mambaonline reported that, besides Aubrey, at least 10 people identifying as LGBTQI+ had been murdered in the past three and a half months.
