 A keenly anticipated showdown between the three-year-old “Queens” of the north and south is off. Cape Town’s dual-Guineas winner Captain’s Ransom was not among the declared runners for the Grade 1 Woolavington 2000 when the final field was unveiled on Monday. This leaves the Joburg Triple Tiara hero War Of Athena alone at the top of the betting boards for Saturday’s big fillies race at Greyville. By contrast, the Daily News 2000 for colts at the same meeting will see a compelling “grudge” race between the two Cape colts Linebacker and Kommetdieding. The Woolavington cut down to just seven runners, with possible challengers being put off by the prospect of a thumping from a couple of the best horses in the country. Nonetheless, it is still a pretty strong line-up of young girls, with the likes of Netta and Princess Calla likely to attract support from punters who like to take on a hot favourite. Indeed, the latter has drawn plenty of apparently shrewd money this week. Netta and Princess Calla – along with shoo-in War Of Athena – are Durban July hopefuls and will be aiming to boost their chances of making the final field for the country’s biggest race on 3 July. Captain’s Ransom was also an early July nomination but was withdrawn a couple of weeks ago. Captain’s Ransom’s trainer, Justin Snaith, has said the 1600m Grade 1 Garden Province Stakes, a weight-for-age event on July day is his filly’s primary target and he might have felt a tough 2000m bunfight beforehand could take the edge off her. The Woolavington is, however, a key race when judging for the Equus Filly of the Year takes place – a choice that is probably down to Captain’s Ransom and War Of Athena. One route for the former to force her way back into contention – and warm-up for the Garden Province – would be via the 1600m Gold Challenge on 12 June. What is clear is that Snaith is set on keeping his star to 1600m races for the time being. Saturday’s companion piece, the Daily News 2000, is better subscribed than the Woolavington with 12 three-year-old colts, many of them still desperate for a July call-up. Linebacker claimed victory in the WSB Guineas a few weeks ago, downing the previously unbeaten Kommetdieding after the latter suffered a rough passage.
