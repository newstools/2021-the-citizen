The late Zulu regent, queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, has been granted a special category 2 provincial funeral. This was announced on Tuesday by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala. “On behalf of the provincial government, we applaud the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to honour the late regent to the Zulu nation queen Shiyiwe Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu,” Zikalala said. The Premier has appointed a team of four MECs to work with the royal family to facilitate the farewell for the queen. The MECs have met with the royal family and have been advised of the following: Dignitaries have been flooding the royal house to pay their last respects, the latest being Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize on Tuesday. They have also weighed in on the ongoing tensions at the family. These emanate from a secret meeting between late king Goodwill Zwelithini’s siblings prince Mbonisi and princess Thembi without Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi’s knowledge or that of the late regent. Mkhize also commented on simmering tensions at the royal family house.
