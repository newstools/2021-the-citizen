Jaguar-Land Rover (JLR) has announced it will start testing a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) based on the Defender this year as part of its Project Zeus development plan. Set to start appearing on roads in the UK towards the end of 2021, the prototype Defender will generate electricity and therefore forward momentum from a hydrogen cell powering an electric motor with the only emission being water. Aside from conventional on-road and city driving, the prototype will also be evaluated off-road with the eventual aim of producing ten million FCEVs by 2030 to complement the reported 10 000 refuelling stations that will exist by then.

Expect more details about the Defender FCEV and possible other models forming part of Project Zeus to be revealed over the coming weeks and months.
