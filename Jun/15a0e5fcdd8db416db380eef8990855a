Since the announcement of Thomas and Skhumba in the Morning on Kaya FM the dynamic duo have been praised for their morning show. Radio personality and legend Thomas Msengana and comedy star Skhumba Hlophe have already cemented themselves as a formidable team on the airwaves. The pair told The Citizen the response had been amazing. Skhumba coming from his popular weekly Friday show on Kaya FM says it has been an “honour” to appear on Kaya FM. “Being here is just an honour. Just being in this building for someone like me, for where I came from, the opportunities are scarce. I am grateful for being here.” ALSO READ: ‘This is how radio should sound’ – Twitter reacts to Thomas and Skhumba show The chemistry between the two is electric outside the studios as well and the two just understand each other.
