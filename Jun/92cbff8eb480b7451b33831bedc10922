Sunday is the first day for 12- to 16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, with 55 percent of the population so far having received two doses in the Middle Eastern nation.

Washington will donate 750,000 vaccine doses to ally Taiwan, a cross-party delegation of US senators say as they arrive on the island. The high-profile delegation and gift come as Taiwan accuses China of hampering its efforts to secure enough doses as part of Beijing’s ongoing campaign to keep the island isolated. The novel coronavirus has killed at least 3,723,381 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1000 GMT Sunday.

After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 472,531 deaths, India with 346,759, Mexico with 228,754 and Peru with 186,073.
