BMW has expanded the limited edition Mzansi moniker from the locally built X3 introduced last month, to the model that preceded it, the now imported 3 Series. Like the X3, the 3 Series Mzansi Edition mainly receives a number of cosmetic add-ons normally not offered as standard on models equipped with the ever popular M Sport package.

Less dramatic is the interior which comes as standard with a glass sunroof, the 64 colour ambient lighting package, M branded seatbelt, Alcantara/sensatec faux leather seats and the BMW Live Professional Cockpit made up of the 10.25-inch iDrive infotainment system with 7.0 operating system as well as the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. Carbon boot spoiler contrasts the black exhaust outlets and faux diffuser. Unlike the X3, the 3 Series Mzansi Edition will be offered on the 318i, 320i and 320d with no added power or torque. This means outputs stay at 115kW/250Nm for the former, 135kW/300Nm for the 320i and 140kW/400Nm for the latter. All units are once again paired to the eight-speed Steptronic gearbox, albeit with the sports ratios plus paddle shifters. Now available, the BMW 3 Series Mzansi Edition offers a choice of five colours; Alpine White, Portimao Blue, Mineral White Metallic, Black Sapphire Metallic and Mineral Grey Metallic. 318i Mzansi Edition – R831 524 320i Mzansi Edition – R863 692 320d Mzansi Edition – R908 126
