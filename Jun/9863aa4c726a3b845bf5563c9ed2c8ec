That was President Joe Biden’s message Wednesday in launching a huge final push to inoculate 70 percent of the US adult population by the national holiday of July 4th. “That’s right: get a shot, have a beer,” President Joe Biden said in a speech announcing the campaign to meet his Independence Day target.  The White House has recruited everything from big brewers like Anheuser-Busch to small Black-owned barber shops to spearhead the effort. “We’re asking the American people for help,” Biden said. “It’s going to take everyone…, so we can declare independence from Covid-19 and free ourselves from the grip it has held over our life for the better part of a year.” Biden said the country is on the cusp of achieving the 70% goal.
