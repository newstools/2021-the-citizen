He was born on 28 April 1924 in Chinsali, in what was then known as Northern Rhodesia. Kaunda, popularly known by his initials KK, was head of the main nationalist party, the left-of-centre United National Independence Party (UNIP) which led the country to freedom from British colonial rule. Initially a popular leader, Kaunda became increasingly autocratic and banned all opposition parties. He eventually ceded power in the first multi-party elections in 1991, losing to trade unionist Fredrick Chiluba. While in power, he hosted many of the movements fighting for independence or black equality in other countries around the region, including South Africa’s African National Congress (ANC). Later in life, he regained stature as one of Africa’s political giants, helping to mediate crises in Zimbabwe and Kenya. Compiled by Siyanda Ndlovu Additional reporting by AFP
