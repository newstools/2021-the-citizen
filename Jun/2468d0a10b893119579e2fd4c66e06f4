A DA MP in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will know on Monday whether the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will proceed with an attempted murder case against him. It is alleged that Mlindi Nhanha, 51, shot his brother-in-law, Mxolisi Daniel, for intervening in a dispute between him and his wife. Nhanha is also the party’s spokesperson in the Eastern Cape.

Nhanha, who is out on R500 bail, is scheduled to appear in the Alice Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning in connection with the incident. The NPA will announce its decision in court. News24 asked Nhanha for comment on Monday, but the MP, who is yet to break his silence on the matter, declined to comment. It is alleged that Nhanha allegedly assaulted his wife Vatiswa on 4 April, following an altercation, and that Daniel chased him out of the homestead. The NPA charge sheet states that Nhanha became violent toward his brother-in-law and that he went to his car, took his firearm and fired a shot at him. However, he missed. Nhanha left the homestead and Daniel reported the matter to police at the Alice police station. The politician was arrested the following day and his firearm was confiscated.
