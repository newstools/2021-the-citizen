The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has gazetted the new regulations following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address on Sunday. One of the amended regulations could see Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema imprisoned or fined following the party’s statement and his media briefing in which he vows to defy the President and also call on others to do the same.

We will only support measures based on the rapid rollout of vaccines,” the party said.
