The Eastern Cape outfit finished this season in 15th place on the DStv Premiership standings and have to try to save their top flight football status by winning the promotion/relegation playoffs. Manyisa, however, hasn’t had much game time at the Chilli Boys, but a source at the club has revealed that the midfielder’s good relationship with chairman Chippa Mpengesi will see him with at least an extension of one more season to his contract. “He (Manyisa) is really hoping that the club survives relegation because he knows that the chairman will extend his stay. He hasn’t played much since he joined the, but he is very close to the chairman and he likes him a lot. Right now he is at camp with the rest of the squad preparing for the playoffs,” said the source.
