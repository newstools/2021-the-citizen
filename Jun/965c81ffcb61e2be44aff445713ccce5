With Springbok selection just around the corner, centre Wandisile Simelane is set to enhance his growing reputation against the Sharks at Ellis Park in the Rainbow Cup on Saturday. Lions coach Cash van Rooyen said on Thursday Simelane’s star is shining brighter all the time. “For Wandi, and any player, it’s a big honour to be involved with the national team and he is very excited to move in those circles,” said Van Rooyen. “That level of professionalism and information is invaluable; it will be great for him and he could bring that all back to our team.” Looking ahead to the match, Van Rooyen said he wasn’t reading too much into the fact the Sharks are resting a number of big-name players. “We are all part of the process to prepare players for the Boks and those players fall in that category,” said Van Rooyen. “But no team will select a side which they think won’t be competitive,” he said.
