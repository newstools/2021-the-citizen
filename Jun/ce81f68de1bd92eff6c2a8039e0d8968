Thanks to the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund, YouTube Music has expanded its commitment to Black music through its YouTube Music scholarship. The new scholarship opportunities, launched to help Black artists thrive, will go towards enabling Black artists in YoutTube’s Class of 2022 to commercialise their work. Grant applications for the YouTube Music scholarship powered by the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund Class of 2022 open on 21 June 2021. According to YouTube, eligibility has been expanded to include songwriters and producers, allowing Black artists in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, UK, US, Brazil and Australia to apply.

The 21 grant recipients in the inaugural Class of 2021 achieved incredible growth, not only on YouTube but also in their careers. This is thanks to resources such as one-on-one support, seed funding, training and networking programmes that helped recipients achieve: Another programme called Future Insiders, which aims to equip at risk and underserved youths who aspire to enter the music and creative industries with skills in content development, will be expanded globally later this year.

YouTube concluded its statement by adding that it remains committed to being an advocate and ally of the diverse communities that call the platform home. This is despite not publicly commenting on the conduct of one of its early Black Voices grant funding recipients, Macgyver MacG Mukwevho, when he repeatedly offended the LGBTIQ+ community in the past few months. YouTube has promised to continue to expand its efforts to support other marginalised and underrepresented communities.
