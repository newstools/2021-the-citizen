Yes, sustained load shedding is back. Just as the country passed a collective sigh of relief that load shedding ended on earlier this week, another bout of short-notice lights out Stage 1 and Stage 2 notices surfaced almost every day, with mundane regularity. Previously, Eskom hinted that this may likely be the best it is going to get, with a cold and dark winter on the cards for South Africa. If you cannot beat them, join them, and with the price of generators, fuel and inverters not within easy reach, it may be best to prepare for load shedding every day.        Adding up everything, you would need less than R 5000 to loadshed-proof your life. It may sound like a lot, but beyond food and its such as books or gas refills, very little needs to be spent again. So, if it is true and we are facing at least another 2-3 years of load shedding, hacking out of the dark comfortably will cost you the same as a monthâ€™s electricity bill for home. And it is a worthwhile investment.
