SuperSport will be crossing their fingers in the hope that AmaZulu, Baroka and Kaizer Chiefs beat Swallows, Pirates and Arrows respectively. “We would love to finish in the top three, it is still a possibility mathematically, we just have to focus and work hard because it is not going to be easy,” Tembo told Phakaaathi. After succumbing 3-1 in the Tshwane derby in a match that confirmed Mamelodi Sundowns as DStv Premiership champions and Tembo says his players are over that defeat, which was their seventh of the season. “There is a lot of confidence in the team and we are prepared to meet Maritzburg, it is a very important game because we want to finish the last two games on a high. It is not going to be an easy game, they are fighting to be in the top eight so we have to be on top of our game,” said Tembo. He added: “I have been happy with our performances even though the results have not been favourable. If we continue to perform like this, the results will take care of themselves. I feel that the team is playing well. The pressure is to achieve our objective which is to finish above where we finished last season. We just want to do well in the last two games.”
