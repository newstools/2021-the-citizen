Trainer Paul Reeves holds the key to the Pick 6 at Durbanville racecourse on Wednesday, with his game sprinter Fighter the best banker option on a very competitive programme. Reeves currently tops the “Who’s Hot” trainers’ log for Durbanville with a first-three ratio of 53%, while his stable’s percentages for the season as a whole are more than respectable for a small, family-centred operation. At Cape Town’s country course on Wednesday, the former jockey saddles just two horses and they both have excellent chances of winning. A neat brace would go nicely alongside one that Reeves Racing notched earlier in June. The yard’s standout comes in the eighth and last race, an MR74 Handicap over 1000m. Fighter, a four-year-old gelding with three wins from 18 starts under the belt, is likely to start as the favourite as he is clearly fit as a fiddle with two wins and two thirds from five runs since late-January. All those efforts were at Kenilworth, but Fighter does have a Durbanville course-and-distance victory on his earlier record. Other ticks alongside his name are for jockey Grant van Niekerk, who has won on him, and a near-perfect No 5 draw on the left-hand turn. Drawn in pole position is the main threat, Gimme Aces from the Justin Snaith-Richard Fourie machine. This three-year-old has a 6kg weight pull, but weight isn’t always the major factor in dashes over the minimum trip. Plus, Fighter seems to be in more of a mood to belt it of late. Reeves’s other runner is Galiek Yo Baby in Race 4, a Maiden Plate for fillies and mares over 1250m. The chestnut has been hammering on the maiden door for a while now and deserves to have it open for her. Last time out she suffered a minor injury when placing third behind dead-heaters. Craig Zackey has been in the Galiek Yo Baby irons three times, for a second and two thirds, so should know how she rolls. Improving juvenile Grayswood Pink is likely to be the challenger. Zackey could have a profitable day himself – with the likes of Penny Trumpet in the second race and Bereave in the sixth – while tuning up for his Saturday date with Durban July destiny aboard lightly weighted outsider Nexus.
