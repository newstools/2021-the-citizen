According to Netwerk24, the party left South Africa on 10 May and every tourist had to present a letter certifying that they had tested negative. Four later died in Windhoek, while two died after their return to South Africa. One of the deceased is Danie Blom, owner of Savanna Tours, the company that arranged the trip. He was airlifted to Johannesburg and died last Sunday.
