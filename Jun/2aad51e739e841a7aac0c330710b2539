For nine days South Africans have pinched themselves and been careful not to ask too loudly why there have been no load shedding schedules floating around on their timelines. Without jinxing it, The Citizen sought clarity from Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha who responded with good news. Mantantsha said the consistent electricity supply can be attributed to Koeberg nuclear power station on the West Coast generating power at full capacity. Koeberg has been unable to provide a consistent electricity supply to the country since January.
