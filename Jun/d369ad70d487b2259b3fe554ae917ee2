Later, in 2015, she opted for a move to Potchefstroom, where she earned a diploma in sports science from North-West University. Having graduated, she went on to enrol for a B Tech in sports management at TUT in 2018, moving back to Pretoria and signing a deal as a sports ambassador for the institution. One of South Africa’s most accomplished athletes in any sport, Semenya has juggled her studies and her athletic career for more than a decade, while being locked in a lengthy court battle in an attempt to have controversial gender rules overturned. A two-time Olympic gold medalist and three-time world champion, the 30-year-old athlete holds the South African women’s records over every distance from 400m to 1,500m. She is trying to qualify for this year’s Tokyo Olympics in the 5,000m event after being prevented from competing in her specialist 800m distance.
