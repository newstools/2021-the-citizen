Four suspects succumbed to gunshot wounds and 23 others were injured as police battled 27 heavily armed men in Midrand on Friday. It is still not clear what the suspects had planned to do, but acting provincial police commissioner Tommy Mthombeni said they had gathered inside a house in Midrand. Mthombeni said police received information that led them to the address where suspects had gathered.

Cele described the scene as a war zone. He said the suspects came from different parts of the country and others from neighbouring countries. “I have seen an army here. They are an international group themselves,” Cele said. “We have people from KZN, Gauteng, and Zimbabwe. They were prepared for this. “Whatever they were going to do, it was going to be serious and have a big impact. These are people at war, for them to be 27 and armed means they were prepared to eliminate whatever was standing in their way,” Cele said.
