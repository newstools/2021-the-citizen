Action SA candidate elections kicked into gear on Saturday, with Herman Mashaba, casting his vote at the Orlando Communal Hall, Mooki St in Orlando East. The party named its Gauteng mayoral candidates earlier this month with Tshwane acting mayor Abel Tau in the race for the capital city’s next executive mayor. Action SA leader and former DA executive mayor of Johannesburg, Mashaba, will be up against community activist Suraya Holt and former councillor Lincoln Machaba. Mashaba launched ActionSA in 2020, initially known as The Peoples Dialogue. Mashaba believes “the work of rebuilding our nation starts with local government elections”. ActionSA claims to be based on the Direct Democracy model, in which people decide on policy initiatives directly. “We have launched the first Direct Democracy platform in South Africa, allowing voters to choose candidates that will serve them, and not us”, Mashaba said. Throughout the course of the day, candidate elections will be taking place at the following locations: Johannesburg: Ekurhuleni: Tshwane: In addition, online voting will remain open until 23:59 on Sunday, 27 June 2021.
