The cross-examination of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi by former Armscor CEO Kevin Wakeford at the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture is taking place on Thursday. UPDATE: ‘I am anti-corruption,’ ex-SACAA manager tells Zondo commission Last year, commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo granted Wakeford leave to cross-examine Agrizzi, who had a heart attack in hospital in October last year, after the former Armscor boss was implicated in the list of individuals said to have benefited from Bosasa, now African Global Corporations. Wakeford, who was a consultant to Bosasa for about eight years, allegedly received R100,000 a month for helping Bosasa “resolve” its issues with the South African Revenue Service (Sars). The former Armscor boss has since denied allegations of corruption, describing them as “false”, “vague” and “unsubstantiated”.
