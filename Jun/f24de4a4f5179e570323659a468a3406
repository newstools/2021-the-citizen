According to reports in Turkey the deal is said to be worth US$1.8 million. The Malatyaspor president said revealed they were in advanced talks with the club and would not like to discuss the matter on public platforms. Hadebe moved from the Naturena camp to join Turkish side Yeni Malatyaspor in 2019 and had a successful stint featuring consistently in the Super Lig top XI after notable weekly performances. “We haven’t shared this issue yet, and the reason is this: We agreed with the American team 90 percent, but a clause was put there,” the club president told Turkish publication MalatyaHaberabout the Warriors defender’s move to America. The Lanky defender is set to travel to America for a medical test which is said to be the last process for the defender’s move to the MLS. “The player will go, have a health check, and after these processes are over, both the American club and we will make a statement. For this reason, we cannot say that the transfer is over and therefore we did not share this issue,” the president added.
