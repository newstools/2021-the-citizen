SA Rugby confirmed on Friday that the two Tests against Georgia, as a precursor to the Castle Lager Lions Series, will be played in Gauteng to give the Springboks a jump-start as they return to international rugby after 19 months out of action. The Boks will make their return to action at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Friday, 2 July, in the first Test against Georgia, which will also be their first outing since the Rugby World Cup final on 2 November 2019 and Jacques Nienaber’s debut as head coach.
