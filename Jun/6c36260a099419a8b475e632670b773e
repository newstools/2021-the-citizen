Chris Smith in for Morne Steyn, Nizaam Carr for Marco van Staden and Jan Uys for Janko Swanepoel – those are the significant changes to the Bulls team from last week for their Rainbow Cup final against Benetton in Treviso, Italy, on Saturday. Steyn and Van Staden are unavailable because of Springbok duty, while Swanepoel moves to the bench for the big north-south final. The rest of the side is unchanged from last week’s match against the Sharks, which the Bulls won to secure their spot in the final. Marcell Coetzee will again lead the side, as he’s done ever since regular captain Duane Vermeulen was ruled out of action because of an ankle injury. The Bulls have been boosted with the inclusion on the bench of prop Lizo Gqoboka and livewire No 9 Zak Burger.

Benetton is a great team, and have been in amazing form this season and it is a privilege going up against them in the final.” Italian outfit Benetton went unbeaten in their northern section – the Pro14 competition. This is the Bulls’ first trip to Italy and the two sides have never met before in any tournament.
