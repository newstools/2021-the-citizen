Goalkeeper, Siyabonga Mbatha has left AmaZulu, but is not going to Pirates. Phakaaathi had previously been led to believe that Mbatha would join the Buccaneers when he left Usuthu. But he has made a U-turn and has now signed a three-year deal at Golden Arrows.

What I can tell you confidently now is that he has joined Arrows. He penned a three-year deal at the weekend and will join the team when they get together for pre-season training in July,” said the source.

Mbatha had been out injured at the time but Mothwa came in and claimed the position, making it hard for Mbatha to win it back on his return.

Ncikazi has subsequently left to join the Orlando Pirates technical team,
