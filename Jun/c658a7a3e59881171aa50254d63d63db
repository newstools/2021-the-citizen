Did you know that there are 48 types of salespeople, 48 different kinds of leaders and so, around 48 different personality types? Imagine your first job isn’t quite the right fit for you, a bit of a square peg in a round hole. Yet, it remains on your CV forever and as such, for example, you are profiled against this part of your life moving forward. So, it is really important that you are profiled in the right way by prospective employers, business partners etc. Watch Tanya Kunze and Thabo Magubane in episode 8 of Changing Lives and learn more about these 48 types and why they matter to your work life.  Changing Lives is an independent project created by author and neuroscience coach Tanya Kunze and executive producer Hein Kaiser to effect positive change in South Africa, and the world. The project is shaped around 67 short online episodes where Kunze takes viewers on a journey of self-discovery, reframing the new normal and providing insight on how we can change ourselves, and our personal realities. “It’s free to anyone and everyone,” says Kaiser. “The idea came about after challenging personal experience during the pandemic and seeing so many friends and family go through the same, if not worse. I wanted to find a way to spread positivity and goodwill.” The release of the Global Happiness Index earlier this year, showing how joy nosedived, added further fuel to the quest. “Tanya was introduced to me via a mutual friend, I shared the concept with her, and immediately Changing Lives was born.” Kunze is sharing all developed material, much of which is included in her bestseller The Power of Positivity, at no cost. She developed the material, validated over the last 11 years with over 15,000 people inspired and trained by Kunze around the world.
