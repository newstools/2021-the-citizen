The Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) has suspended contact classes effective from Monday due to the rising number of  Covid-19 cases in Gauteng. The university on Monday announced the death of a student due to Covid-19 and reported an increase in the  number of students and staff testing positive for Covid-19. “The rise in infections in communities, including our TUT community, calls for more vigilance and adherence to the required Covid-19 rules to help stop the spread,” said deputy vice-chancellor of teaching, learning and technology Prof Stanley Mukhola. “In view of these risks, students will resume online teaching and learning from Monday as per the approved multimodal teaching and learning strategy. Students will be provided with the necessary data to support them with online learning.” ALSO READ: EFF calls for university student debt, registration fees to be waived this year The university said it would make arrangements to ensure invigilated tests and exams continue as scheduled.
