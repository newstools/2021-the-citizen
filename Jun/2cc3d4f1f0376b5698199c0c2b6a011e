The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has received documentation for the Sinopharm vaccine developed by the China National Pharmaceutical Group in China. “SAHPRA will now commence with evaluating the data in assessing the efficacy of the vaccine,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. This is as the country battles the third wave of Covid-19 infections amid the slow vaccine rollout. As of Wednesday, the country had 130,416 active cases of Covid-19, with 17,493 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours. Gauteng is the epicentre of the third wave, having recorded 10,806 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. The province has 67,618 active cases. The Gauteng Provincial Command Council is scheduled to meet today as rumours swirl the province could be taken to Level 5 to curb the spread. However, the EFF has argued that Level 5 restrictions are not the solution and has called on the country to vaccinate more people.
