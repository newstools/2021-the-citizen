How to close your Edgars account has been a question that’s vexed consumers for years. Even before RCS acquired the Edgars debtors book, consumers complained. It did not get much better under RCS management, but this is about to change with a news customer service model in stores where customers can log a closure request. “Since migration of the accounts onto the RCS system, account closures have been one of our key focus points.
