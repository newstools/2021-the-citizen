Kia has revealed price and spec details of a surprise addition to its local model line-up in the shape of the Pegas compact sedan. On sale in parts of the Middle East, Asia, China and certain South American markets since 2018, the Pegas is in fact the sedan version of the current generation Rio and while it resides on the same platform, boasts a traditional three-box sedan design with a claimed boot capacity of 475-litres. Rear facia has elements of certain South American Chevrolet models. Apart from the boot section that required a redesign from the C-pillar back, the Pegas is otherwise similar to the Rio with Kia’s rival for the Honda Ballade, Volkswagen Polo Vivo Sedan and Nissan Almera and sister brand Hyundai’s Accent offering a choice of two trim levels and a single powertrain option. In terms of specification, the entry-level LX rides on 14-inch steel wheels in addition to boasting: Pegas’ interior is identical to that of the Rio. Swopping the steelies for 14-inch alloys, the top-spec EX also receives cruise control in addition to the following: Up front, motivation is provided by the same 1.4-litre petrol engine as the Rio with outputs of 69kW/132Nm. A five-speed manual gearbox is standard on both grades with the EX having the option of a four-speed automatic. Available in five colours; Clear White, Titanium Black, Marcato Red, Blue Stream and Aurora Black Pearl, the Pegas is covered by a five year/unlimited km warranty as well as a prepaid option of a four year/60 000 km service plan.
