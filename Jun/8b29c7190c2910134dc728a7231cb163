That’s a little hot and I’m still smiling,” he exclaimed with a laugh. “I’ve got half a pharmacy in the kitchen. I’m taking a lot of meds so thanks for all the suggestions.” He added that he was taking controversial Covid-19 treatment, ivermectin, which is originally intended for the treatment of parasite infestations in both humans and animals.
