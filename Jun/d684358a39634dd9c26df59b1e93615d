Having played at the infamous calabash, FNB Stadium for the past decade the stakeholders saw an opportunity to commemorate the success of the Cup through the years by hosting the match at a venue that is a stone throw away from where both teams originate. “The venue change will see stable mate, Castle Lager host the British Irish Lions series match between the Springboks and the British & Irish Lions on the 31st of July 2021 while the Carling Black Label Cup match will be moved to the 1st of August 2021 to a 17h00 kick-off.” Castle Larger Brand director Arne Rust says they would have loved to have the fans at the new venue, but they will make sure that they have nice experience watching from home. “Although we would have loved to have Champion voices in-stadia to witness the very first Carling Black Label Cup at the spectacular Orlando Stadium, we will ensure that viewers have a memorable experience from the comfort of their homes. The Orlando Stadium also provides the perfect backdrop for the Soweto Derby. Furthermore, we believe this change of venue will only affect the fan experience positively,” Rust said.
