According to the South African Football Association (Safa) website  Monare was only 50/50 to take part in the game against the Cranes. It is Blom’s first call-up to the Bafana Bafana squad, and is a boost for him after he was left out of the Under-23 team that is in Egypt for friendlies ahead of this year’s Tokyo Olympics. “I believe every coach has his own philosophy and the way he wants to play. I am not taking this (the omission) badly because it just shows that I don’t feature in the coach’s plans and philosophy. I will just keep on doing my best at Chiefs,” said Blom, according to SowetanLive. Blom, who has come through Chiefs’ development ranks, played in 27 of Chiefs’ 30 DStv Premiership matches this season, and also featured heavily in their run to the Caf Champions League semifinals. This is his first ever Bafana Bafana call-up.
