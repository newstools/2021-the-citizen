The Lions will remain an under-strength side for Wednesday evening’s Currie Cup clash with Western Province at Ellis Park. None of a seasoned group of players including Jannie du Plessis, Jaco Kriel, Roelof Smit, Stean Pienaar, Burger Odendaal, Sti Sithole, Courtnall Skosan and Willem Alberts (injured) will be in action. And Wandisile Simelane and Elton Jantjies are also unavailable because of Springbok duty. But, the Joburg-based team do welcome back lock Ruben Schoeman, hooker Jaco Visagie and scrumhalf Morne van den Berg this week. Ivan van Rooyen’s men are coming off a shock loss to the Pumas in Mbombela, while Western Province hammered an under-strength Blue Bulls side at Loftus Versfeld last Saturday.
