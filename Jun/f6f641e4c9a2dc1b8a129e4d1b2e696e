West Indies selectors responded to the embarrasment of a dismal innings defeat in the first Test by recalling fast bowler Shannon Gabriel and left-handed batsman Darren Bravo for the second Test against South Africa which starts at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground on Friday. Neither featured in the opener in St Lucia which South Africa won by an innings and and 63 runs just before lunch on the third day of the first Test.

He was substituted during the first Test after being struck on the helmet by Kagiso Rabada during the first innings. “Shannon Gabriel has been declared fully fit and as someone who was the spearhead of the attack before, he has returned to the 13-man squad,” said lead selector Roger Harper when announcing the line-up on Thursday.
