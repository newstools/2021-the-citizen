A farmer from the Dullstroom district in Mpumalanga died in a freak accident last Thursday when he fell between a tractor and water cart. Hendrik van der Merwe, 63, died at the scene, Anje Grobler, a family friend told Middelburg Observer. “It was a freak accident. They started a fire on Thursday and like my father, the water cart had to be shut off before the day. The tractor stopped and Van der Merwe got off to see how much water was still in the tank,” Grobler said they heard from eyewitnesses. “The tractor started moving forward due to the amount of water in the tank. I think he thought of jumping up from behind so that the big wheel of the tractor would not hit him. So he climbed between the tractor and the water cart.” ALSO READ: Primary school boy dies in freak accident The eyewitnesses said his jacket got stuck on the water cart and he fell, possibly due to the rocky area.
