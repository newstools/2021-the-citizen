With production of the Mercedes-Benz X-Class and Renault Alaskan already over, Nissan has confirmed its Barcelona plant in Spain will close at the end of this year and that sales of the European Navara will end in 2022. Alluded to last year with the reveal of the brand’s restructuring plans aimed at saving ¥300-billion and reduce output to 5.4-million units, Automotive News Europe reports that the Nissan Motor Ibérica S.A plant will shut down after 41 years in December, due in part to declining bakkie sales on the Old Continent versus those of vans.

The closure comes amid Nissan’s initial decision to continue with production for Europe instead of sourcing the Navara from other markets such as the main plant in Thailand. A facelift version was revealed in 2019, but the heavily updated current model now also assembled in South Africa had been ruled out on the back of worsening sales.

The ruling out of Thailand has subsequently put renewed focus on the Rosslyn plant outside Pretoria as the likely facility for Europe, but with sales ending next year, the plant will, for now, assemble the Navara only for the local market as well as those in sub-Sahara Africa.
