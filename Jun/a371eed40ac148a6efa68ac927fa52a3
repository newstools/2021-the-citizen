Its stablemates, the X3 and X3 M Competition refreshed, BMW has afforded the X4 and X4 M Competition a similar makeover as part of their first mid-life revisions. Like the X3, the X4, which bowed in M40i guise alongside the Competition, receives Munichâ€™s wider new kidney grille, redesigned LED headlights with standard Matrix LEDs or optional Laser Lights, the revised M Sport package and a model exclusive colour called Piedmont Red Metallic. Changes to the rear are easy to spot Also reserved for the X4 is a restyled rear apron with flatter LED taillights, so-called free form exhaust outlets and in the case of the M40i, a model specific M grille in chrome and high gloss black, standard Orbit Grey or optional Jet Black 20-inch M light alloy wheels and the mentioned M Sport package as standard. RELATED: Here in Q4: Refreshed BMW X3 and X3 M Competition debut While carrying over the same tweaks as the X3, the X4 M Competition receives a carbon fibre reinforced plastic rear spoiler and a choice of eleven colours, including the Sao Paulo Yellow hue that debuted on the new M4. Sao Paulo Yellow can now be had as a colour on the M Competition Inside, the Live Cockpit Plus system with the 10.25-inch iDrive infotainment is standard with the upgrading to the Professional bringing the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and added option of a Heads-Up Display. As with the X3, the former system boasts the 7.0 operating system, over-the-air updates, revised touch control rotary dial and the BMW Driving Assistant Professional. Underneath the bonnet, mild-hybrid assistance has been added as standard to all bar the M40i and M Competition, but not for South Africa where the line-up of turbo-petrol and turbodiesel engines will do without added it. Interior of the M40i For now, only two engines are mulled for local introduction; the 140kW/400Nm 2.0-litre oil-burner in the xDrive 20d and the 265kW/500Nm 3.0-litre straight-six in the M40i, both paired to the eight-speed Steptronic gearbox with drive going to all four corners. More derivatives, including the M Competition that now produces 375kW/650Nm, could be added later. As with the X3, the facelift X4 will become available from the fourth quarter of this year with pricing and spec to be announced later.
