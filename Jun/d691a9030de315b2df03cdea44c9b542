The Democratic Alliance (DA) inconspicuously sneaked into the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) march in Pretoria on Friday to demand the approval of Chinese and Russian vaccines by the South African Health Product Regulatory Authority (Sahpra). This after DA on Wednesday declined an invitation by the EFF to join its picket at the offices of SAHPRA to demand the approval of the Sputnik V and Sinovac vaccines.

Meanwhile on Friday, the DA put up posters in the street where the EFF is protesting. Some of the posters read “vaccination now” while others read “stop super-spreader events”. The DA’s poster juxtaposed with EFF posters in Kirkness Street, Tshwane.

Gwarube said to host a mass march like this would not only endanger attendees, but also those who they’ll come into contact with, “a situation which could overwhelm the health system to the breaking point for many of our healthcare workers”.

Ramaphosa is vaccinated and does not care about getting the rest of us vaccinated. We are tired of this government eating money that is meant to save the lives of our people. #MarchToSaveLives pic.twitter.com/BAfilKULHE — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) June 25, 2021
