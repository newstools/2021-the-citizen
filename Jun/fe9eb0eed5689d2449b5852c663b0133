Eskom said on Friday that load shedding would be suspended from 8pm on Friday night. Unfortunately, stage one will be implemented again on Saturday and Sunday evenings “for a limited period”. The power utility explained that “supply constraints have eased during the past two days”, thanks to four generation units returning to service.

Furthermore, Eskom said it expected additional units to return to service over the weekend but would err on the side of caution by implementing stage one on Saturday and Sunday from 5pm to 8pm. At the time of publishing, breakdowns were at 13,625 capacity, while planned maintenance was 1611MW. Eskom has warned that capacity constraints would “continue for the foreseeable future” and urged South Africans to reduce electricity consumption. #POWERALERT1 Loadshedding will be suspended at 20:00 tonight, but Stage 1 will be implemented again on Saturday and Sunday nights for a limited period pic.twitter.com/CGm5bsxOkc — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) June 11, 2021
