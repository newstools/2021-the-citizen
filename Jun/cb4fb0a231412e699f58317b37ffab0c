Remember how the documentary of the Springboks’ journey to World Cup glory “Chasing the sun” pulled at the heart-strings a year ago? Well, there’s more. In a few weeks’ time we’re going to meet one of the big heroes of the Boks’ World Cup triumph in Japan in 2019 and the man who caused a few tears to roll down the cheeks in “Chasing the sun” – wing Makazole Mapimpi. The 30-year-old became a national hero after scoring the Boks’ first try in a World Cup final against England. In the new documentary “Mapimpi” – a RYOBI production – sports fans will get a behind-the-scenes look into who Mapimpi is, where he comes from, and why his journey to the Bok team is such a wonderful story. We’ve been working on this project for over a year. We have a confirmed date for flighting. Stay tuned… pic.twitter.com/gSYtRRLHNe — Mike Sharman (@mikesharman) June 23, 2021  Mapimpi is currently in training with the national squad ahead of the three-Test series against the British and Irish Lions. Producer Mike Sharman says of the story: “We’ve been working on this project for over a year. We have a confirmed date for flighting. Stay tuned…” Based on the feedback and engagement from yesterday’s poster, here’s the trailer for #Map1mp1 in case you haven’t seen it yet pic.twitter.com/vSQ5RNOKWe — Mike Sharman (@mikesharman) June 24, 2021
