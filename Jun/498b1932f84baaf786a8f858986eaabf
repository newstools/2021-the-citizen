Proteas opener Aiden Markram said on Wednesday that a “focus on getting your job done” was a major reason for South Africa’s overwhelming success in the first Test against the West Indies at St Lucia, and it is a habit they don’t want to lose as the second Test looms at the same venue on Friday. South Africa beat the West Indies by an innings and 63 runs in the first Test in what was one of their best all-round performances for a long time. The bowlers were outstanding and the batsmen fought hard on a lively pitch.

Conditions were difficult, but hopefully we can now win in foreign conditions more consistently.” ALSO READ: First Test wrap: Elgar impressed with several departments It is often said that teams take on the personality of their captain, and there is no bigger fighter, no one more determined on the field, than new skipper Dean Elgar. “Dean has been brilliant as captain now for the last three weeks and it’s great to have someone really experienced like him to lead us, a pretty young team,” Markram said. “He has realigned everyone and is driving those standards that will more often than not lead to good results. “It’s black or white with Dean. You always know where you stand and he’s the perfect man for the job at the moment.”
