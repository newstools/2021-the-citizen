Two World Cup-winning Springboks have suffered burns following a fire pit incident in Ireland. Munster Rugby players RG Snyman and Damian de Allende, who were both part of the Bok team that beat England in the World Cup final in Japan in 2019, have been treated for burns after the accident at the weekend. Two other Munster players were involved in the incident, namely  CJ Stander and Mike Haley. While Haley and Stander will return to training this week after sustaining burns to their hands, there is uncertainty around the severity of the burns suffered by the two Springboks. Both men were included in the South Africa 46-man squad named at the weekend for the series of Tests against Georgia and the British and Irish Lions. A statement by Munster Rugby said De Allende and Snyman had suffered more “substantial burns to legs, hands and face” and will not take part in training and rehabilitation work this week. Both would meet a specialist again later this week.
