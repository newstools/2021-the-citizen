Eskom confirmed that load shedding stage 2 will continue until 10pm on Sunday, 6 June 2021. This announcement comes after the schedule was postponed on Friday in order for Parliament to pass the Appropriation Bill. Eskom said “passing these bills is essential to keeping government operating”.

However, it’s back to business as usual for the rest of the weekend. The embattled power utility has been implementing stage 2 load shedding since Monday due to breakdowns at several of its power stations, including Arnot, Majuba, Kriel, and Tutuka. Eskom previously said load shedding would be implemented until Friday and that power cuts were required to replenish emergency generation reserves lost due to breakdowns. Eskom has, however, again failed to provide a summary of breakdowns or outage schedules for Friday or the weekend and instead directed users to the MyEskom App and website. Municipal customers were told to contact their municipalities for schedules. Stage 2 #loadshedding will resume at 17:00 this afternoon and continue until 22:00 on Sunday, 06 June 2021. Schedules are available from https://t.co/SQhZfdzlHR  /  MyEskom app. Municipal customers must contact their respective municipalities for their schedules. pic.twitter.com/2uupjIB9eb — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) June 4, 2021  Now read: Load shedding suspended Friday so Parliament can pass Appropriation Bill
