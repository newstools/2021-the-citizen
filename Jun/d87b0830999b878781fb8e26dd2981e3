Red Bull’s Sergio Perez won a chaotic Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Sunday with both Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton failing to finish. Sebastian Vettel for Aston Martin and Pierre Gasly for Alpha Tauri completed the unexpected podium. Verstappen crashed with five laps to go and the race at his mercy. Hamilton then locked up at the restart when on target for second. The drama on the streets of Baku left Verstappen retaining the lead in the drivers standings. This was the first win for Perez since joining Red Bull. Perez said: “I’m so happy for today. Normally Baku is pretty crazy but I have to say sorry to Max. “He deserved the win today and it would have been good for the team to get a 1-2 but the win is a fantastic result.
