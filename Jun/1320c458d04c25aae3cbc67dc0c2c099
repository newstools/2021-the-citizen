This is possibly one video President Cyril Ramaphosa would like to disappear on the internet. Last week, the president misplaced his iPad before giving an address and social media went crazy. Ramaphosa looked dazed, looking for a misplaced item. He said: “Do you know where they took my iPad to? This is the problem of always handing out your gadgets to other people. “I had my iPad, I had it in my hand. It’s gone. I have lost it, it seems.” Many music remixes, TikTok and memes videos were made but one of his biggest critics,  MKMVA’s spokesperson, Carl Niehaus couldn’t help but join in the fun on Sunday.

Niehaus wasn’t the first politician to join the conversation of the ‘missing iPad’. Last week, EFF’s Floyd Shivambu said the joke was a “weak and wobbly attempt to spin”. He said Ramaphosa “evidently didn’t know what to say and had no clue what he was expected to say”. “Leaders who respect their responsibilities should always know what to say when, how and why,” Shivambu tweeted.
