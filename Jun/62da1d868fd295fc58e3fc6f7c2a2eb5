The Rainbow Cup SA match between the Lions and Stormers, scheduled for Cape Town Stadium on Saturday, has been cancelled in line with Covid-19 protocols. The decision was taken as part of prescribed precautions advised by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) to limit the risk of further infection in the rugby community. The decision was triggered on Friday following receipt of positive results from scheduled testing of the Lions squad. As determined by the competition rules, the Stormers will be awarded four log points because of the cancellation.
