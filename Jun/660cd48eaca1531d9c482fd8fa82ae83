We hope other drivers will learn from this and make sure they work together to reduce fatal accidents on our roads.” This is the second fatal head-on accident reported on the N1 North in the past 48 hours, the department said. On Wednesday, three people died and five others injured after two vehicles collided head on along the N1-28 north of Polokwane. Reckless driving was cited as the cause of the incident.
