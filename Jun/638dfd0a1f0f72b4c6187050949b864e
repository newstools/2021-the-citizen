Acting Health Minister Kubayi on Saturday morning provided an update on South Africa’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in light of the B.1.617.2 Delta variant. Professor Tulio D’Oliveira, a member of the ministerial advisory committee, confirmed on Saturday the Delta variant, first detected in India, is now the dominant strain in South Africa. Data on the Delta variant spread was extrapolated from sources in KwaZulu Natal, and even though reports from Gauteng are yet to be finalised, it is believed the Delta variant is the driving force behind the surge in cases. The Delta variant has already been detected in more than 80 countries. Dr D’Oliveira said it “is very quickly starting to dominate the global pandemic”.
