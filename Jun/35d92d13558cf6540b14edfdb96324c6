Refiloe Phoolo, known as Cassper Nyovest, took on his fatherly duty and cut son Khotso Izwe Simba Phoolo’s hair.   A post shared by Refiloe Phoolo ???????? (@casspernyovest)  Cassper left a patch of hair at the back of Khotso’s hair, harking back to his 2015 days. In 2015, Cassper inspired a generation of boys into braiding a patch of hair at the back of their heads. He made this look so good, even creating a dance move for it. “He is my son, I can do whatever I want,” Cassper says. The boy earned one of his names, Simba, due to his father calling himself Mufasa. It is clear that he is a mini version of his dad, so Cassper’s fans are yet to see a lot more “mini-me” content from this first-time father. In one picture shared by Khotso’s mother, Thobeka Majozi, Khotso was wearing a big family tree gold chain around his neck and a gold ring. The picture was captioned: “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”   A post shared by Thobeka Majozi (@bexxdoesitbetter)  Thobeka did not have a say in the styling of Khotso’s first haircut. In the picture Nyovest shared he said: “Omg. When? How? I’m never leaving you alone with my son.” Followers are waiting, crossing fingers that Khotso can dance so that he can re-create some of his father’s classic dance move. Looks like their followers are in for a very fun ride.
