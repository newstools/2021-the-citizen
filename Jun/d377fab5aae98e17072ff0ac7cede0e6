South Africa’s top-rated horse, Rainbow Bridge, stood his ground for Saturday’s 50th anniversary running of the Grade 1 Gold Challenge over 1600m at Greyville – a race he won in 2020 before going on to claim his second Cape Met title. Bookmakers are taking no chances and have quoted trainer Eric Sands’s runner at 8-10 – horrendously short odds in a race packed with quality. Also included in the nine-horse Gold Challenge line-up are 2020 Durban July champion Belgarion and 2021 Queen’s Plate winner Jet Dark – alongside other notables like Seeking The Stars, Sovereign Spirit and Catch Twentytwo. This is the final “gold ticket” qualifier for the July and horses who might be needing a good performance are Cirillo, Sovereign Spirit and Trip To Africa. The Gold Challenge has had a stakes boost to R1 million, making it one of the richest events on the racing calendar in the wake of the game’s financial meltdown last year.
