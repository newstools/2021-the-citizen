There seems to be confusion about whether or not Percy Tau will remain at Brighton and Hove Albion next season, with the club and Tau indicating that he will stay at the English Premier League side, while reports in Belgium have heavily linked the Bafana Bafana star with a return to the Jupiler Pro League.

Last week, Brighton CEO Paul Barber, according to Sussex Live  said Percy Tau had been “unlucky” not to get more game time this season, after finally getting to play for his parent club in January, having secured a work permit. Before that Tau had loan spells in Belgium at Union St Gilloise, Club Brugge, and most recently Anderlecht. “These things sometimes don’t always go according to the way supporters think they should or might and the player himself wants to get as many minutes on the pitch as he can,” added Barber. “But ultimately Graham (Potter, Brighton’s head coach) can only play 11 given players at any time and this season Percy perhaps has not had as much football as he would have liked or others might have liked to see him. “But (the) time will come. When that time does come hopefully we will see more of Percy and things will go forward from there.” “I don’t think anyone wants to do that (send me on loan) at this stage,” said Tau. “It has been six months with Brighton. If you loan me out, it is based on what exactly? I didn’t play enough, so I am looking to fight for my position. The team wants me to stay .. you will always see (what happens) in the future, but as things stand we have agreed I will stay.”
