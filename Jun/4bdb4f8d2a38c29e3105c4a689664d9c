Although Gqom musician Babes Wodumo has not officially announced the impending birth of her first child, she no longer seems to be hiding her baby bump when she was recently seen partying up a storm at Soweto’s popular hangout venue, Zone 6. Babes was on the lineup of DBN Gogo’s “Kwa Gogo’s” birthday celebrations at the venue alongside artists such as Black Motion, Riky Rick and DJ Banques. In a video screen recorded from DBN Gogo’s Instagram stories, Babes can be seen dancing on stage alongside the birthday girl while she cradles her stomach and rubs it. Seemingly overcome with joy, DBN Gogo then embraces Wodumo before the video cuts.

This led to questions after a video surfaced of Babes supposedly taking a sip of champagne at her recent birthday celebrations in March. The bottle in her hand in the video is believed to be Moet & Chandon Nectar Imperial which doesn’t seem to come in non-alcoholic variants. Wait guys!!!! Babes Wodumo is pregnant and was seen sipping Moët Nectar from the bottle on camera!!! Tell me is there a non alcoholic Moët? pic.twitter.com/KwdeWFf7O8 — A Radio Unicorn ????
