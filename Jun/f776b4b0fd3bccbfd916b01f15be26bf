A post shared by Nhlanhla Mafu (@nhlanhla_nciza)  The post had a series of beautiful black and white pictures of Nhlanhla and Luvuyo. Luvuyo’s ability to see beauty in everything, she says, is his “greatest gift”. Nhlanhla’s adoration for her son is no secret. She often shares posts, and has previously posted that “there has never been, nor will there ever be, anything quite so special as the love between a mother and a son”.   A post shared by Nhlanhla Mafu (@nhlanhla_nciza)  Luvuyo is the youngest of three boys, preceded by Nkululeko and Thamsanqa. Nhlanhla’s only daughter Zinathi passed away in 2009 after being involved in a horrific car accident while riding with her grandmother. Zinathi sustaining fatal injuries. Nhlanhla shares the children with her ex-husband Thembinkosi Nciza, known as “TK”. The two divorced in 2019 after a 15-year marriage. Their son, Ciza, is following in their musical footsteps, creating a legacy for himself in the industry. Ciza, 20, has been creating music since he was 15 and has recently released a single called Bank Notification. Ciza also modelled for Maxhosa’s SS2021 collection for New York Fashion Week. Music and fashion are on the top of his list, just like his mother and father. TK is hands-on with Ciza’s career, sharing that theirs is “the story of an African father grooming his son to become a superstar”.   A post shared by Golden Boy ???? (@ciza.sa)
