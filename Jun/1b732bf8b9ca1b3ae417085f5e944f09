Springbok loose forward Marcell Coetzee will earn his first cap for the Bulls when they host the Stormers in their Rainbow Cup SA clash at Loftus on Friday. Bulls director of rugby Jake White has tweaked the starting line-up with scrumhalf Ivan van Zyl returning from injury to partner flyhalf Morné Steyn, while wing Stravino Jacobs reclaims the No 11 jersey in place of James Verity-Amm. Besides the inclusion of Coetzee at openside flank, Mornay Smith and Gerhard Steenekamp will prop up the scrum alongside hooker Johan Grobbelaar.
