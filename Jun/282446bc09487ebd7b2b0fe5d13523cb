At this rate, Limpopo needs one more day to complete vaccinating everybody on the list,” Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said. She will be in the Free State on Monday to encourage people to be vaccinated. Joining her will be provincial education MEC, Tate Makgoe, on visits to Seemahale Secondary School in Botshabelo, Pontsheng Primary School and Mpatleng Senior Secondary. “The minister will proceed to the Northern Cape on Tuesday … and the Eastern Cape on Thursday this week. The visits are aimed at encouraging more people to get the vaccine. The department is satisfied with the turnout and remains hopeful the target will be met as scheduled,” they said. The provinces will continue with the vaccine rollout from Monday to Friday.
