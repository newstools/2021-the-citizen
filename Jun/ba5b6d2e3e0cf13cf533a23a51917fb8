Sunday’s episode of Uyajola 9/9 left Twitter users in stitches and disbelief as they watched unfaithful couples get caught on camera. In the first episode, Dineo asked for help because she had suspicions that her partner was cheating on her. She then caught Skhumbuzo with another woman who she repeatedly asked “did I not warn you?” and he was forced to choose between the two of them. Dineo is tired of being used as a ride along and wants to bring a stop to Skhumbuzo’ lies. #Uyajola99 #Uyajola99Sunday Sun at 9pm on Moja LOVE DStv Channel 157. pic.twitter.com/IvwJtQPciF These were some of the reactions: — MojaLoveTv DStv Channel 157 (@MojaLoveTv) June 11, 2021   I like how all these girls are coming for Sthembiso instead of insulting and hitting each other????This is how it should be#Uyajola99 pic.twitter.com/MVPTqwp7k0 — Jessica (@NtseboJessica) June 13, 2021   When the main and the side fight the man together… This should normalised, fight the man not the side. #Uyajola99 pic.twitter.com/1gaM1N6pxc — Lasizwe Dambuza (@lasizwe) June 13, 2021   Utatakho must take it from here #Uyajola99 pic.twitter.com/pMrlZDwE5L — K U L A N I (@kulanicool) June 13, 2021  Based on the American reality TV show Cheaters, Uyajola 9/9 airs on Sundays in back-to-back episodes on Moja Love 157.
