However, Harrismith police’s Brigadier Motantsi Makhele assured the road has subsequently been opened after police managed to disperse the angry crowds. Protesters said last month that the Maluti a Phofong municipality had failed them. On Tuesday they renewed their call for President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene. Demonstrators say water, roads, toilets and electricity are all failing and they want to separate from the municipality, but also do not want to fall under QwaQwa, some 47km away. Intabazwe community forum chairperson Mbuyiselo Shabalala told GroundUp they had been submitting memorandums to the municipality and inviting government representatives to the village to see the situation for themselves, but no one had ever come to their assistance. In a previous protest, schools and shops were forced to close. A 35-year-old truck driver also lost his life after he was pelted with stones by protesters, resulting in him veering off the N5, OFM News reported.
