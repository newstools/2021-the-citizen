On Monday, the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe announced the adjustment of the petrol price based on current local and international factors. South Africa’s fuel prices are adjusted on a monthly basis, informed by international and local factors, said Mantashe. While you won’t be saving hundreds of rands at the pumps from tomorrow, you’ll be saving around R7, depending on the size of your petrol tank. If you’re filling up with diesel, you’ll have to fork out a little more.  International factors include the fact that South Africa imports both crude oil and finished products at a price set at the international level, including importation costs. The main reasons for the fuel price adjustments are due to the contribution of international petroleum product prices and the rand/US dollar exchange rate.
