Former Lions and Springbok wing Ruan Combrinck has joined the Bulls. He will arrive and start training with the Pretoria-based team on Thursday. The 31-year-old, who played seven Test matches for the Boks in 2016, has been in the rugby wilderness for some time. After playing 72 times for the Lions in Super Rugby between 2012 and 2019, Combrinck joined Stade Francais but only ran out for them on four occasions. He also briefly played for the Kintetsu Liners in the Japanese Top League.

The arrival of Combrinck coincides with the departure of loose-forward Nizaam Carr, will be leaving Loftus at the end of July and heading back to his former club in England, Wasps.
