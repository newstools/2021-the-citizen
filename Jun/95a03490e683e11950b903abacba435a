Government confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that President Cyril Ramaphosa would address the nation at 8pm. Ramaphosa is expected to announce stricter lockdown measures as Covid-19 infection rates continue to soar. South Africa’s official death toll currently stands at 57,879, with many provinces including Gauteng entering a third wave. Ahead of the meeting, it was reported that another alcohol sales ban, as well as an earlier curfew and a limit on public gatherings, would be enforced. Spar’s TOPS liquor outlets in KwaZulu-Natal have already preempted another ban on alcohol sales, announcing the removal of alcohol from their shelves just hours before the scheduled family meeting.
