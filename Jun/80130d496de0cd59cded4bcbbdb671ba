Nigella Lawson has compiled plenty of cookbooks, but only a few cookie recipes have been done by the chef. She has finally perfected her chocolate chip cookie recipe, which produces the freshest cookies that are crispy on the outside and yummy and chewy in the middle. “I may be picky, but to my mind or my mouth, a cookie that’s too crisp feels dry and disappointing and a cookie that’s too chewy tastes like dough.
