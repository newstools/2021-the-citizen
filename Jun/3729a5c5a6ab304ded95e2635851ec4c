However, another source close to Harry and Meghan said that Harry had been in conversation with the Queen before the birth of their daughter and he would have mentioned the name in the conversation. “During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the name,” the source said. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been demoted on the royal family website from their placement just below Prince William and Kate Middleton, to being listed below Prince Andrew and the Wessex royals. The website was under construction for some time and now that it is up and running, Meghan and Harry have been given new placements on the list, while both their biographies have been updated. The Mirror reported that Princess Beatrice made an announcement on the same day as Harry and Meghan’s third anniversary that she and her husband are expecting their first child. Princess Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksband were not impressed with the sister’s actions, as they feel that it was unfair for the couple to grab the headlines and attention that day. According to Mirror, Harry and Meghan reportedly announced they were expecting baby Archie, who is now two, at the wedding of Eugenie and Jack in October 2018. Princess Eugenie has since forgiven her cousins for what they did and feels her sister was wrong for stealing their thunder on their anniversary.
