The fiancee of former president Jacob Zuma, Nonkanyiso Conco also known as LaConco, has put a spanner in the works on their relationship status. LaConco appeared in the first season of Real Housewives of Durban, but the star barely shared information about her relationship with Zuma. With many of her disclosures being “read between the lines” and not naming him, she left her cast members and audiences frustrated. Since then, LaConco has continued to be silent about whether they are still together. However, she tweeted this week something that could be seen to end the conversation about her partnership.  I refuse to be wealthy and single, no kuzosha abantu????????. — LaConco (@la_conco) June 7, 2021  At the end of the tweet, no kuzosha abantu is translated to “no matter what people say”. LaConco wore what appeared to be an engagement ring throughout the show, but people have noticed she isn’t wearing it any more. ALSO READ: Are you still with Jacob Zuma?
