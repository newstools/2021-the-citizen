In the last couple of episodes of The River viewers have been shocked at how Lindiwe Dikana, who is played by Sindi Dlathu, has “changed”. Nyakallo, played by Jessica Sithole, was introduced to the Dikana mansion by her aunt, Flora, who she had to fill in for her choral duties. The character, who first comes across as timid and sweet, soon fell in love with Lindiwe Dikana’s husband who would take her as his  second wife. Lindiwe calls herself “Madlabantu” and “Kalashnikov” and is known as a powerful mine owner of Khanyisa Diamonds who will stop at nothing to attack anything or anyone who posses as a threat to her or her family. Lately, her character has left viewers confused because she hasn’t thought of annihilating her husband’s new love interest. Instead, she told Zweli she would rather be the first wife than divorce him and lose him. Twitter users had mixed feelings about Zweli’s decision to take a second wife.  This tweep said: “Zweli is hurting our feelings as viewers, you know.” Mara Zweli wa re hurt’a waitse ????????, nna ga ke happy shame #TheRiver1Magic pic.twitter.com/c52BLGo6vY — MASEGO_M????????

After this Nyakallo will go to the mine to check on the Diamonds ????????#TheRiver1Magic pic.twitter.com/oAxlGsoqGt — Cape Town Twins (@TheCPTtwins) June 24, 2021
