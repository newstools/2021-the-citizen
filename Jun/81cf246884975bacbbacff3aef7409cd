Radio personality Anele Mdoda recently spread some powerful words of wisdom on dropping the “strong black woman” narrative during Khutso Theledi’s radio show segment. The video has since gone viral on social media with women being inspired by Anele’s advice and celebrities such as Unathi sharing the video in agreement with Anele’s sentiments. In the video Anele begins by telling women: “You don’t have to be strong any longer ladies. Be soft. Be flowers. Be dolls. Be vulnerable. Be taken care of.”   A post shared by Unathi.Africa (@unathi.co)  The radio personality then goes on to tap into the “strong black women” narrative and how it is a tool used by many people to manipulate women and burden them with unnecessary problems and issues which Anele refers to as “BS”. “That strong black woman thing is a trick that they sell you so that they can load you with BS and then expect you to be able to bounce back from it. You don’t bounce back from it,” she said. Khutso and her co-hosts are heard in the background of the video voicing agreement with what she is saying.

You go to therapy. You heal. You close yourself off. You recuperate and you come back, but what you’re not going to do is be strong for someone else’s child,” Mdoda said. Unathi shared the video on her Instagram page with the caption: “THIS @zintathu ENKOSI……It’s not my responsibility to make my partner happy. It’s not HIS RESPONSIBILITY to make me happy. It’s our individual responsibility to work on our own happiness. So that when we meet we meet in happiness and LOVE and being the best versions of our selves with eachother.
