WoF urged community members, motorists and landowners to remain vigilant at all times, and to report any flare-ups. According to the South African Weather Service, the Garden Route district reported a particularly intense fire danger index last week, which was predicted to last from Saturday to Tuesday. In nearby central Karoo, the fire danger index is expected to decrease in intensity by Tuesday, but flare up slightly again on Thursday. In June 2017, nearby Knysna and Plettenberg Bay was ravaged by devastating fires that were started by humans. Seven people died, hundreds were left homeless, and countless amounts of flora and fauna perished. In addition, the fires cost municipalities billions in health, environmental, agriculture and human settlement costs. Updates to follow as more information is made available.
