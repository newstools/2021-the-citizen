Dyamani is not related to the boys, however, the three know each other. The boys spent the night at Dyamani’s relative’s house. “Dyamani, who slept in between the boys, started to play with the 13-year-old’s private parts while they were sleeping. The boy tried to remove her hand but she instead inserted his penis into her and had sex with him. “The following day, the boy told his friend what had happened and the friend advised him to report the matter to his parents,” Anelisa Ngcakani, NPA Eastern Cape spokesperson, said in a statement.
