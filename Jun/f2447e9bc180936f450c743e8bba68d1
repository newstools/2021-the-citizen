A CNN contributor who went on a leave of absence eight months ago after exposing himself during a Zoom call. Jeffrey Toobin returned to the air on Thursday. Toobin, a prominent legal affairs analyst for CNN, apparently unwittingly exposed himself in October during a Zoom call with colleagues from The New Yorker, where he was also employed. The New Yorker fired him after the incident and Toobin had not featured on the CNN network until his appearance on Thursday.

A CNN spokesman confirmed to the network that Toobin will return to his role as chief legal analyst. Besides working at The New Yorker and CNN, Toobin is a former prosecutor and the author of several books.
