Gauteng hospitals are under extreme pressure amid the third wave of coronavirus infections and as a result, the department of health has suspended visiting hours until further notice. As of Thursday, 11,767 new cases and 100 deaths brought the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa to 1,786,079. Covid-19 infections in Gauteng continue to rise exponentially. To reduce the risk of patients in Gauteng hospitals contracting the virus, drastic measures were needed, the provincial department of health said. The department said it will “make an exception for one visitor, however, said visitor would not be allowed to spend more than 15 minutes with the patient”. In addition, the visit must be pre-arranged and authorised by the attending doctor and the visitor must be screened for temperature and Covid-19 symptoms. It goes without saying that all visitors should, if their appointments are approved, adhere to Covid-19 protocols at all times.
