It is always important that people remember to take the necessary safety precautions on social sites to ensure a positive online experience. TikTok, specifically, is encouraging its own community to brush up on their in-app safety knowledge as well as update their settings where necessary. “TikTok is all about having fun and sharing lighthearted moments with friends or others around the world. In order to foster a space where creativity can thrive, the platform has been designed to safeguard the wellbeing of everyone in its community through various in-app safety features. We are always looking for ways to improve our current safety features and are continuously introducing new ones to help users feel comfortable,” says TikTok’s Head of Public Policy in Africa, Fortune Mgwili-Sibanda.
