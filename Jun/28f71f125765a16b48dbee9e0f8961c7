South Africa’s MotoGP star Brad Binder has confirmed a contract extension with the factory supported Red Bull KTM team until 2024. The Potchefstroom native, who finished fifth in this past weekend’s Italian Grand Prix at Mugello overshadowed by the death of Moto3 racer Jason Dupasquier in qualifying, has been part of the Austrian outfit since his debut in Moto3 nine years ago with his switch to motorcycle racing’s premier class last year resulting in an historic victory at the Czech Grand Prix in Brno, the first for a South African since 1981, and the first ever for KTM. Currently lying eighth in the overall standings with 35 points, two points clear of Petronas Yamaha SRT’s Franco Morbidelli but 70 behind Monster Yamaha championship leader Fabio Quartararo, Binder created another piece of history by clocking 362.4 km/h during the third official practice session at Mugello, the equal highest top speed ever in MotoGP.
