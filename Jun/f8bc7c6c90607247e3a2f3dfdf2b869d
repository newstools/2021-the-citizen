The World Health Organisation (WHO) has given the Covid-19 variants of concerns new names by Greek alphabets to avoid stigmatising nations where they were first detected. The new names will replace existing scientific names which the organisation says will help in public discussions. In a statement, the WHO said the old names were difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting “As a result, people often resort to calling variants by the places where they are detected, which is stigmatising and discriminatory,” reads the statement. “To avoid this and to simplify public communications, WHO encourages national authorities, media outlets and others to adopt these new labels.” ALSO READ: Indian virus variant is in SA – What is it and what now?
