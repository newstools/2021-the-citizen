Television presenter and radio personality Bonang “Queen B” Matheba  made the Twitter trending list yesterday after Nigerian radio personality Toke Makinwa posted an image of herself and to tweeps said she looked like Matheba. The two media personalities are no strangers to one another as they are friends and Makinwa appeared on Matheba’s reality show, Being Bonang, on a previous season. The comparison of the two media personalities is not the first time and it’s making the two beauties trend.  But guys, Toke and Bonang literally became friends because they look alike. ????????‍????????‍ Toke has mentioned this previously. — Lemba Princess ????????

According to Good Reads  she reveals the truth behind her 14-year relationship with the man she finally married, a marriage that ended in an atrocious scandal that nearly brought her to her knees. The Nigerian radio personality is also the owner of Toke Makinwa Luxury that sells handbags in different colours. Another tweep disagreed that the two media personalities looked anything alike. Bonang and Toke are nowhere near ‘looking alike’ whatsoever. Look at Bonang Look at Toke

While Matheba has not confirmed she has moved to America, she arrived in the city last month. Say goodbye to who?! ???????? https://t.co/OlguufDndt — Bonang Matheba ????
