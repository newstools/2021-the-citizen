The DA says it will lay criminal charges against Health Minister Zweli Mkhize over what it alleges to be an irregular contract awarded to Digital Vibes. Digital Vibes is the subject of an investigation by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) after Mkhize said the health department’s investigation found the tender bidding process followed was in contravention of the Public Finance Management Act. It is alleged Digital Vibes is controlled by Mkhize’s former aide, Tahera Mather, and his former personal assistant, Naadhira Mitha, although the two are not listed as directors.

The president needs to instruct the minister to step down pending the full investigation by the SIU. The minister cannot continue being both the player and referee in an investigation that he is the centre of,” the DA said. Ramaphosa said he was waiting for the SIU’s report before making any pronouncements, while ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe called for the SIU to finish its investigation before any action was taken.
