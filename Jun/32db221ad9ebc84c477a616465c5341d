New signing Marcell Coetzee has been handed the Bulls captaincy in the absence of the injured Duane Vermeulen. The Springbok loose-forward, who recently joined the Bulls from Ulster, made his first appearance for his new team in last week’s win against the Stormers. Vermeulen has an ankle injury, which required surgery, and he won’t play again in the competition. Coetzee will also move from the side of the scrum to eighthman. Joining Coetzee in the loose-trio will be regular lock Ruan Nortje, who replaces the injured Elrigh Louw, while Marco van Staden will wear the No 6 on his back in what is a new-look back-row combination. Taking Nortje’s place in the second row is Janko Swanepoel.
