South African opera star Pretty Yende on Tuesday accused French customs agents of treating her with “outrageous racial discrimination” at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport, a claim strongly contested by police and airport sources. “Police brutality is real for someone who looks like me,” the soprano, who is black, wrote on her Instagram account a day after arriving for a string of performances in Paris. Pretty Yende, 36, said she was “traumatised” after being “stripped and searched like a criminal offender” at the airport. “I am one of the very very lucky ones to be alive to see the day today even with ill-treatment and outrageous racial discrimination and psychological torture and very offensive racial comments in a country that I’ve given so much of my heart and virtue to,” wrote Yende. She did not say why she was pulled aside for questioning, but a French police source said the singer had arrived from Milan on a South African passport without a visa.

She was released an hour-and-a-half later with a visa allowing her to enter French territory, an airport source said, adding that Yende was held for “verification” purposes that had nothing to do with the colour of her skin.
