Former South African cricket captain Faf du Plessis said he is suffering from memory loss following a sickening collision while fielding during a match in the United Arab Emirates. Du Plessis suffered concussion after crashing head first into the legs of a fellow fielder, Pakistan’s Mohammad Hasnain, while diving to stop a boundary during the Pakistan Super League match between his team, the Quetta Gladiators, and Peshawar Zalmi in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.
