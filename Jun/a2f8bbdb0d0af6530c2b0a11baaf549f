Irregular expenditure at all nine provincial health departments has, over the past five years, skyrocketed. News24 reports that despite the billions in irregular expenditure, very few contracts were cancelled, while most provinces cancelled no contracts despite racking up high irregular expenditure bills. In the Gauteng health department, only two tenders were cancelled due to corruption or irregular expenditure over the past five years. This, despite the department racking up more than R12 billion in irregular expenditure during this time. These details were contained in Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize’s response to a written parliamentary question from DA MP Siviwe Gwarube. The question had been posed before Mkhize’s special leave. RELATED: Municipal irregular expenditure increases by approximately R7bn The Gauteng health department recorded six cases of corruption worth R12.6 million (R12 600 944.78) in the 2019-20 financial year. In 2017-18, corruption cases worth R2.8 million (R2 875 716.49) were recorded. In the Eastern Cape, the health department had no tenders cancelled because of irregularities or corruption. The province is, however, currently using manual systems which are paper-based. “The plans to digitise procurement processes have been included on the departmental strategic plan, and processes are underway to engage the [State Information technology Agency] for assistance,” Mkhize said. The embattled North West health department’s irregular expenditure bill for the past five years tops R4.7 billion (R4 728 202 000).

In Limpopo, no irregular expenditure was recorded because of corruption within the department. Mkhize said that in Mpumalanga, the provincial health department did not have known cases of corruption reported. He, however, said the department cancelled contracts with an appointed service provider for the supply of perishable and non-perishable food due to non-compliance with the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF).

No contract was cancelled due to irregularities and/or corruption in the past five years.” The collective irregular expenditure amount for the past five years stood at R2.6 billion. In the Western Cape, there was no record of corruption or contract cancellations due to irregularities. The province also recorded the lowest irregular expenditure.
