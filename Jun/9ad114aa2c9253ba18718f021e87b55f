Falling short in a race against time to prepare for the showpiece, road cyclist Daryl Impey has withdrawn from the South African team for the Tokyo Olympic Games. Impey, who rides for professional outfit Israel Start-Up Nation, revealed on Sunday that he was still recovering from injuries sustained on the final stage of the Ruta del Sol in Spain last month, where he and Australian rider Robert Stannard crashed in a sprint for the line. “I wouldn’t sleep at night knowing I wasn’t in the best condition possible to represent my country,” said Impey, who finished 40th in the road race at the 2012 London Olympics and 28th at the Rio Games in 2016.
