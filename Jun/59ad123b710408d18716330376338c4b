The South African Revenue Service (Sars) announced today all its tax branches will close temporarily from 1 July and that it is planning resume physical branch visits on 16 August 2021, while reviewing this continuously. Branch filing will therefore not start on 1 July and taxpayers must not go to SARS branches. However, the temporary closure of the tax branches will not affect the start of the filing season for individuals who traditionally file via eFiling or the SARS MobiApp. They are encouraged to continue filing digitally from 1 July. According to SARS it remains an essential service in terms of the Disaster Management Act. “We have always stressed the importance of balancing the continuity of this service with the risk of transmission,” a spokesperson said. “With rising case numbers and the onset of the third wave of the pandemic, we have decided to close our tax branches temporarily for physical visits because our digital platforms allow taxpayers to continue to fulfil their obligations online, as demonstrated during the peak of the second wave.” ALSO READ: Kieswetter: Sars is stable, working without ‘fear or favour’ During this time, taxpayers who require assistance to file online will be helped telephonically with the support of dedicated SARS staff.
