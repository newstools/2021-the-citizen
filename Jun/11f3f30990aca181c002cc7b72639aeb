The Premier Soccer League have announced that Sekhukhune United will be promoted to the DStv Premiership, after the league received a court order on Saturday upholding a decision to award Sekhukhune three points for a game they originally lost 1-0 to Polokwane City in January. ALSO READ: Five possible transfer targets for a new-look Kaizer Chiefs A South African Football Association arbitration hearing gave Sekhukhune the three points, after they successfully argued that Polokwane had failed to field the five Under-23 players in that match, breaking the PSL’s GladAfrica Championship rules. Previously a PSL Disciplinary Committee had deducted the points from Polokwane, but had not awarded them to Sekhukhune, who subsequently challenged that decision. Polokwane City and TS Sporting then challenged the Safa decision, but the PSL announced on Saturday that Judge Roland Sutherland had upheld the Safa arbitrator’s decision. As it stands, this means that Royal AM slip into  second in the GladAfrica Championship, with the extra three points taking Sekhukhune into the DStv Premiership as Championship winners, while Royal AM will have to try their luck in the play-offs.
