Among the clubs after his services are Mamelodi Sundowns. The Brazilians coach Manqoba Mngqithi admitted last week that he would love to have Kutumela in his team. I like him, I am not sure if he is coming to the club or not, but I like him,” said the Mamelodi Sundowns co-head coach. “He is a good football player I have always liked him…. you can ask him. From when he was still at Baroka, I liked him and I still like him today,” he added. Maritzburg said to be open to offers and have put a price on Kutumela’s head. “Any club that wants him must go to Maritzburg United with at least R15-million in the pocket. That’s how much they want,” said a source close to the club. Kutumela had an excellent campaign with United, netting 14 goals in all competitions, while the 27 year-old also made a major contribution in Bafana Bafana’s recent 3-2 friendly victory over Uganda.
