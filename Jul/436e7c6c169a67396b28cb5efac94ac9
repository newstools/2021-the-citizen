In the latest update on Sunday’s Palmiet booster pumping station explosion, Johannesburg Water said repairs should be done by Thursday. Three voltage motors used to run the pumps exploded, rendering the station inoperable. As a result, the pump station can only run at 55% capacity, which means many suburbs are without water.

On Monday, Johannesburg Water said in a statement all Midrand suburbs were affected. A detailed breakdown of what suburbs remain affected has not yet been provided. Johannesburg Water spokesperson Eleanor Mavimba said the South East tower and Midrand reservoirs were under “enormous strain”. However, Rand Water has been able to repair some electrical switchgears, which has helped with pumping capacity. The station is not yet running at full capacity. Johannesburg Water has arranged for additional water tankers to assist residents.
