It’s not only Celtic. There are also teams in Gauteng, KZN and Cape Town who are keen to sign him, but our first option is Orlando Pirates. We will wait for the chairman (Irvin Khoza) to tell us what he has decided. I’m sure we will hear from the chairman soon.“Orlando Pirates fans love Justice and even now, they have voted for him for the Black Label Cup and he wants to repay the faith shown to him by the fans. He is also eager to play for Orlando Pirates this season, but that of course depends on what the chairman and the technical team wants. But I tell you that coach Josef Zinnbauer is keen to work with Justice. “Chabalala joined from Free State Stars in 2016, but has often been loaned out to Chippa United and Celtic.Last season he made 20 appearances in all competitions for Phunya Sele Sele.
