Reports of unrest across parts of Johannesburg have been shared on social media on Sunday morning, 11 July, presumably as part of the ‘Gauteng Shutdown’ protest action. Here’s what we know. The N1 near Sebokeng was closed following reports of unrest. JMPD warned of service delivery protests on the N1 near the Sebokeng exit. – both the north and southbound have been barricaded with rocks and burning tyres. Officers have been deployed to the scene and motorists are advised to use alternative routes. It’s still unclear whether the protests in Seboken are linked to the FreeJacobZuma movement.

He said the M2 was completely blocked off at Denver between the Maritzburg offramp and Cleveland while officials are diverting traffic to the old Cleveland road for motorists lanes barricaded by rocks and burning tyres: “We don’t want to risk anyone’s life by allowing them to drive on the freeway where they can or will be shot at.” Minaar encourages motorists to make use of alternative routes. Those coming from O.R Tambo International Airport should use the N12, while motorists coming from the South of Johannesburg should use the R24. Alternatively, Minaar says those going to the northern side of Johannesburg should use the N1 via the Western Bypass. There have been reports of protests along the N3. While it cannot be confirmed at the time of publishing, officers have been dispatched to investigate. Yusuf Abramjee on Saturday said reports of unrest have been streaming in from Jeppestown, Denver and Alexandra. In addition, the Joburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) warned of protest action on the M2 near the Denver exit. “Both the east- and westbound are blocked off by rocks and burning tyres. Officers have been deployed; road users are advised to use alternative routes”, the department said.

(@IndWorldThinker) July 11, 2021 South Africans have been criticising the protests on social media. One citizen said he is “very disappointed about what s happening [in South Africa], people who should be blamed are top officials [because] they failed to solve their problems”. Another added: “That’s their aim, to loot people’s shops, nothing else. Zuma is in Escourt, why don’t they go and shut down the police station? Here in [Johannesburg], it’s gonna be war”.
