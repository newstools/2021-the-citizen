Talented loose forward Hacjivah Dayimani has signed a long-term contract with Western Province. Dayimani, who spent his formative years in the Cape, has been on loan in the Currie Cup from the Lions and has made the move back to Cape Town permanent by signing for the next two years. A dynamic loose forward who is comfortable at flank or No 8 and has also represented the SA Sevens Academy, the 23-year-old’s signing is seen as a boost for the province’s loose forward depth.

I am looking forward to what the future holds for me here.”
