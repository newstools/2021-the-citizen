President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to address the nation at 8pm tonight regarding the government’s response to the ongoing violence and looting which has broken out across several provinces. This comes after the earlier announcement that the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) would be deployed to assist in quelling the violence. According to the Presidency’s statement, the decision to deploy the SANDF comes after a request for assistance received from the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS). The military deployment will happen in parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, in terms of Section 201(2)(a) of the Constitution, which allows for their deployment in cooperation with the police. On Sunday night, Ramaphosa warned those responsible for the violence that the full force of the law would come down on them. “The majority of South Africans do not and should not tolerate violence, the destruction of property and the endangering of livelihoods. People are urged to report criminals by sharing videos of criminal activity with the police.It is also a crime to possess, receive and use stolen goods, or to interfere with the police in their execution of their duties,” said the Presidency. In Monday’s statement, the Presidency also warned against posting fake news on social media, and has urged the reporting of criminals and videos of criminality with the police.
