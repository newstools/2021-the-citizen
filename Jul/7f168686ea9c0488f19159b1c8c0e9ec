The Olympic record breaker will be competing in the 100 metre butterfly, the 200 metre butterfly and 200 metre freestyle events in the upcoming 2021 Olympics in Tokyo. Talking to Times Live, Chad said he was considering an entry into the 1,000 metre freestyle event. However, he would first need to find out when that event would be taking place in relation to his main events. “I have to get a lot faster in the 200 free, 1:48:48 is not good enough but in 2016 it was the same thing. I went 1:48, won nationals and then got the silver at the Olympics,” he said.
