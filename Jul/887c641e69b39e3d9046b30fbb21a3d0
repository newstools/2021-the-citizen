South African restaurant chain Mugg & Bean has had to debunk fake news that it would be closing down. This after it found itself trending on Sunday when ANC Ekurhuleni Regional Chairperson and Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina said the franchise would be closing. “Morning people of South Africa, as we are busy arguing why Zuma must be incarcerated, Mugg & Bean SA has announced its permanent CLOSURE in SA. Since the start of the pandemic, when are we going to start discussing problems that confront our people?” tweeted Masina. The mayor has since deleted the tweet.

Mzwandile Masina says he is willing to go to jail for Jacob Zuma  Last month, Masina responded to a tweet shared by Government Communications director-general Pumla Williams (@mirriamp): “Dear @mirriamp we’ve found the family and we are informed babies are well. Will share the information with National Gov, I know we were a joke ystday when Gov was genuinely looking for family. Some of our local comrades have been assisting this family. So we are good OK.” Williams had expressed concern about not being able to contact Gosiame Sithole or verify the births. Social media users poked fun at Masina. I wrote a status that Mugg and Bean has announced its permanent closure. My cousin asked for the source. I said Mzwandile Masina. She asked the one who visited the 10 babies. I’ve since removed the status. — Rethabile Ntshinga ???????? (@RethaNtshinga) July 4, 2021  Just a reminder that the source of the Mugg & Bean story is Mzwandile Masina. The person who confirmed the 10 babies story. — Goolam (@goolammv) July 4, 2021  “I’ll resign if Cyril is elected in Nasrec. I have seen the Tembisa 10 babies and they are doing well.
