A post shared by Gordon Ramsay (@gordongram) F For a spicy hoisin sauce with a real kick, double the amount of sriracha and reduce water to ¼ cup (60ml). For a more British take on the ribs, preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Season the ribs well all over with salt, followed by a generous sprinkling of Chinese five-spice mix, patting the seasoning into the meat. Heat a roasting tray on the stove with a little olive oil and sear the ribs on all sides until they are golden brown and crisp. Add 2 cups Hoisin sauce and 1 ½ cups chicken stock and bring to a boil, simmering for 1 minute. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Place the roasting dish back in the hot oven and cook for 1 hour until tender, flipping the ribs halfway through cooking. Remove from the oven and place back on the stove. Heat the marinade and reduce for 8-10 minutes until the sauce is thick and syrupy. Turn the ribs in the sauce to ensure they’re fully coated. You can use seedless English cucumbers if you can’t find the Persian variety, just peel off most of the tough skin before smacking. TIP: For a time-saving shortcut, there’s nothing wrong with using store bought hoisin sauce or Chinese Five Spice. This recipe is courtesy of Gordon Ramsey’s website, click here for the original.
