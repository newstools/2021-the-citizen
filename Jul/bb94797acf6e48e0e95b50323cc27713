Having showcased the all-new Golf 8 GTI on local shores in April, Volkswagen has confirmed that the eagerly awaited newcomer will be revealed officially on 19 July in the shape of a virtual launch on its Facebook page. Debuting after a series of delays largely attributed to Covid-19 and more recently the global semi-conductor chip shortage, the GTI, which will be joined later by the Golf R reportedly as the sole versions of the eighth generation Golf, will be powered by the long-serving 2.0 TSI engine rated at 180kW/370Nm.
