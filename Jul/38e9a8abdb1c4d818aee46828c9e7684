Roger Federer on Monday became the oldest man to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals since the dawn of the open era in 1968. Federer, who will be 40 in just under five weeks’ time, eased past Italy’s Lorenzo Sonego 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 to make the last-eight at the All England Club for the 18th time. “I felt after the first set I was able to control things. I couldn’t be more excited to be in the quarters,” said Federer whose match took place on the final ‘Manic Monday’, so-called because all the last-16 ties in the men’s and women’s event are played.

Medvedev was leading Hurkacz 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-3, 3-4 when play was halted for the night due to rain. “It is not fair for anyone. I have been in these situations before — but these guys are young and they can recover,” said Federer. “Unfortunately they are very, very good too, so hopefully it rains again tomorrow… I’m kidding, I’m kidding!”
