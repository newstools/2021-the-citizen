So I am excited to be back and to be part of a team like Cape Town City. “City are a team that always wants to in trophies … I am excited to work with Eric Tinkler, I know him from my first stint at Wits when he was assistant coach, so I am looking forward to rekindling that relationship, we had some success. It would be nice to do it again in Cape Town for Cape Town City.” Keet has joined City on a three-year deal, and is set to be their number one shot-stopper after Dutch goalkeeper Peter Leeuwenburgh returned home, where he has signed for FC Groningen. The former Bidvest Wits ‘keeper will no doubt look to reclaim his place in the Bafana Bafana set up and catch the eye of new Bafana head coach Hugo Broos ahead of September’s 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.
