The Gauteng government has announced that the daily Covid-19 infection cases indicate the province is approaching a peak in the third wave of infections. The province says the high number of Covid-19 infections remains a very serious concern. It said hospital admissions continued to rise and were placing a heavy strain on the healthcare system. “As the number of infections and number of hospitalisations increase, so has the number of deaths,” the provincial health department said in a statement.
