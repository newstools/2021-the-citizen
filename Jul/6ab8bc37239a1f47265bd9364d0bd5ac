This latest food trend on TikTok is a smart solution when you run out of potatoes to make fries. The app has continuously helped content creators showcase their innovative ideas, especially with food. The newest one has to do with pasta. Just a few months ago a feta pasta was once the rave but pasta chips now look like they are here to stay. Already made cooked pasta is soaked in olive oil, then spiced with Italian seasoning and as much parmesan cheese as you like. Instead of dee -frying, a healthy option of an air fryer is utilised. Place the pasta in the air fryer for 10 minutes at 200°C. The hashtag on TikTok has 35.4 million views. People have used their own preferred cheeses and seasoning.
