A powerful KwaZulu-Natal Family related to former president Jacob Zuma has distanced itself from ongoing violent protests linked to his incarcerations. The Gcaba brothers, who own the lion’s share of the taxi business in parts of KZN and are nephews of the former head of state, released a statement on Monday distancing themselves from the ongoing anarchy in KZN and parts of Gauteng. “While we support President Jacob Zuma and his family as our relatives, especially during this time of both bereavement and his incarceration, we have made it a point that the lines are not blurred,” reads the statement.

We value all human lives as a responsible and law and law abiding citizens,” the statement reads.
