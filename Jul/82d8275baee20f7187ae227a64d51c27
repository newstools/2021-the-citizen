Kommetdieding has had his merit rating raised from 122 to 127 following his triumph in the Grade 1 Vodacom Durban July over 2200m at Greyville on Saturday 3 July. The National Horseracing Authority handicappers were unanimous in their view that fifth-placed Rascallion was the best line horse in the race and left him unchanged on a mark of 123. An NHA press release added: “It needs to be borne in mind that Kommetdieding was two pounds or 1kg under sufferance at the weights, which partially explains the five-pound raise in his rating.” Runner-up Linebacker and third-placed Got The Greenlight were both raised from 124 to 126, while the only other increase was for the filly She’s A Keeper who was raised from 96 to 104 after finishing tenth, 6.55 lengths behind the winner. “She did in fact achieve a mark of 104 when winning the Grade 2 Greyville 1900 at her latest win but was capped to 96 in that race due to the specific conditions applicable to the Greyville 1900. “She’s A Keeper more than confirmed that she is much better than 96 in the July, where she in fact runs to a rating of 110, but the handicappers opted to only adjust her to 104.” The only merit rating drop was for sixth-placed Sovereign Spirit who went from 122 to 120. The NHA press release for Vodacom Durban July meeting continued: Jonsson Workwear Garden Province Stakes (WFA) (Grade 1) Zarina has had her rating increased from 107 to 119 after she captured the Grade 1 Garden Province Stakes for fillies and mares on weight-for-age terms over 1600m at Greyville on Saturday. It was the consistent runner-up PRINCESS CALLA who was used as the line horse, leaving her unchanged on a rating of 118. The only other increase was for 4th finisher MOUNT LAUREL, who goes up to 114 from 108, this was only a partial adjustment as she runs to a mark of 117. Only one horse was given a rating’s drop, with FREESTATE STAR being cut to 106 from 108. Post Merchants (Grade 2) Kasimir has had his rating increased slightly from 124 to 125 following his success in the Grade 2 Post Merchants over 1200m at Greyville on Saturday.  It was 2nd placed CHANTYMAN who was deemed to make for the best line horse, which leaves him unchanged on a mark of 119.  In rating the race this way, both MK’S PRIDE and SOLID GOLD also run to their ratings, which leaves them unchanged on marks of 120 and 107, respectively.  IKIGAI also runs to his rating and is thus unchanged on a mark of 108. The specific conditions of this race do not allow for an increase in the rating of any horse aside from the winner.  Therefore, 4th placed CARTEL CAPTAIN and 5th finisher GAINSFORD remain unchanged on marks of 115 and 99 respectively, although they respectively ran to marks of 118 and 105.
