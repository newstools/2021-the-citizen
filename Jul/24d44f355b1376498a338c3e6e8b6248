I feel it’s gone up a level from where we were in Jersey (at a training camp) and we’re starting to see a better understanding of some of our tactics. “There’s some new player combinations for us to have a look at this Saturday – which is good information for us as the Test series approaches. “My congratulations to all those playing their first game as a Lion, and also to Hoggy too – who I am sure will lead the side by example.” The Joburg Lions are scheduled to name their lien-up at 5pm SA time. Saturday’s match kicks off at 6pm. TEAM NEWS ???? Here is our #LionsRugby team for the battle of the big cats as we face @LionsRugbyCo on Saturday ????
