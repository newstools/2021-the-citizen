Team SA has been handed its first Covid-related setback ahead of the Olympic Games, with the entire Springbok Sevens squad being placed in quarantine after a passenger on their flight to Tokyo tested positive. “There are a total of 18 Team SA members – 14 players plus four from management – who have been put in a quarantine facility some 30 minutes from the Olympic village in Tokyo,” the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) confirmed yesterday. While she admitted it was “an unfortunate situation”, with the Blitzboks arriving in Japan among the medal favourites, Team SA chef de mission Patience Shikwambana insisted there was no real cause for alarm.

South Africa will turn out in Group C in the opening round, against the United States, Kenya and Ireland.

The first members of Team SA management arrived in Tokyo late last week. The first South African athletes to arrive in Tokyo were the rowing squad, who were in a training camp, and the rugby sevens squad were the second group to arrive at the quadrennial Games which gets under way next week.
