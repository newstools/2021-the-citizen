The African National Congress (ANC) has postponed its scheduled National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting scheduled for the weekend amid developments of the situation outside former President Jacob Zuma’s Nkandla homestead in KwaZulu-Natal. This was announced by the party’s spokesperson Pule Mabe on Friday as scores of the former president’s supporters continue to flock in Nkandla to stand in solidarity with Zuma.
