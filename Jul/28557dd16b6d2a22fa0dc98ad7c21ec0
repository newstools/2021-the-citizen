With less than a year having passed since the unveiling of the updated Hyundai Kona, the South Korean marque has now announced price and spec details of the revised crossover. Once again positioned between the Creta and Tucson, the Kona, of which 1 700 units have been moved since its local market introduction four years ago, receives a redesigned front bumper, slimmer lower headlights with integrated daytime running LEDs, a revised grille and lower air intake, a new rear bumper with a faux satin silver skidplate, tweaked taillights and new wheel arch cladding.

Dimensionally, the Kona measures 4 205 mm in overall length, with the inclusion of the N Line exterior resulting in a further gain of 10 mm. Wheelbase stands at 2 600 mm with the width remaining at 1 800 mm and the claimed length at 1 550 mm or 1 560 mm in the case of the N Line. Boot space is rated at 544-litres with the rear seats up, although this expands to 1 296-litres with the 60/40 split bench folded forward. On the model front, Hyundai has upped the Kona line-up to three with the inclusion of the N-Line, but with alternations to the drivetrain options. In this regard, the normally aspirated 2.0-litre petrol remains, but drops the torque converter automatic gearbox for a CVT known as Intelligent Variable Transmission (IVT) in Hyundai-speak. Still producing 110kW/180Nm, the Executive spec 2.0-litre will get from 0-100 km/h in 9.7 seconds and top out at 195 km/h. Claimed fuel consumption is 6.5 L/100 km. Replacing the previous 1.0 T-GDI unit, the new 1.6 T-GDI serves as the second powertrain option for the Executive and the sole choice for the N Line, and comes hooked to a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox that replaces the six-speed manual the former offered. Delivering 146kW/265Nm, the setup allows the Kona to sprint from 0-100 km/h in 7.7 seconds with the claimed v-max being 210 km/h. Fuel consumption meanwhile is a claimed 7.5 L/100 km. As before, and like the 2.0-litre, drive in the T-GDI goes to the front wheels only. Hyundai has however confirmed availability from early next year of the red-hot Kona N as the second performance N model after the i30 N. In terms of specification, the Executive receives cruise control, a wireless smartphone charger, a reverse camera and rear parking sensors as standard, as well as the following: Building on these, the N Line receives red stitching on the seats, steering wheel and gear lever in addition to an electric driver’s seat, LED headlights and a10.25-inch digital instrument cluster. Also included is: As before, the Kona line-up comes standard with seven year/200 000 km warranty as well as a five year/75 000 km service plan.
