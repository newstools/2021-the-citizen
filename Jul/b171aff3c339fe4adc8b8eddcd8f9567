Cele did, however, say arrests would be made for those who flouted lockdown regulations. “Just because we didn’t pick them on that day, it doesn’t mean we’re not going to,” he said. Minutes after the ANC’s announced Niehaus’ suspension on Wednesday, the MKMVA spokesperson said he intended to appeal the party’s decision “with immediate effect”, and that he was still a “dedicated liberation fighter”.
