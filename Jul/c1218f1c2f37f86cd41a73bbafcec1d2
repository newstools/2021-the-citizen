Moja Love is jam-packed with the most dramatic and chaotic South African television shows, and Uyajola 9/9 seems to take the cup as the host of the show Molemo Maarohanye, also known as Jub Jub, heads on weekly quests to assist people in finding out whether their partners are cheating on them. Sunday’s episode saw the shocking end of Khamo’s relationship after she wrote to Jub Jub to express that her partner no longer answers his phone calls next to her, but now answers them in private and secret. Jub Jub came to Khamo’s rescue, tracked her boyfriend down and found that he has been cheating on her for quite some time with a woman named Palesa. Khamo is used to her husband answering his calls next to her, now he has become secretive. #Uyajola99 #Uyajola99Sunday Sun at  21:00 & 21h30 on Moja LOVE DStv Ch157. pic.twitter.com/hNy8E9nvMN— MojaLoveTv DStv Channel 157 (@MojaLoveTv) July 9, 2021 In the episode, the camera crew as well as the show’s host are seen chasing Khamo’s boyfriend in the streets after he dashes off once he notices that he has been found by the Uyajola 9/9 team.
