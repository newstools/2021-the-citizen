However, police spokesperson Vish Naidoo told The Citizen there was no evidence that suggested links to Zuma at the moment. “There are protests on the N2 between Sibiya and Umhlanga, but they are not related [to Zuma]. The police will monitoring the situation as time goes on,” he said. Posters have been circulating on social media, one of which was shared by the former president’s daughter, Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, which says “Shutdown KZN” in support of Zuma. Zuma-Sambula has also since shared videos of the protests in some parts of the province. READ MORE: #BookTitlesForBaba: Should Zuma write an autobiography in prison?
