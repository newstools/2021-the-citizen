Maritzburg United coach Ernst Middendorp is said to be the favourite to replace Seema. According to a source, Middendorp wants to secure his future after it emerged that the Team of Choice has been put up for sale. “Chippa (Siviwe Mpengesi) wants a coach that would make sure that the team does not fight for survival next season and Ernst is a top coach that will not only retain the club’s top flight status, but will also qualify for the top eight,” said the source. Middendorp coached Chippa between January and March 2015. Former Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has also been linked with the vacant head coach job at Chippa. According to reports, Hunt is one of the coaches who have been shortlisted for the post. ???????? Aboubacar Bemba Sangare ????
