The work was expanded to include communications on Covid-19. The controversial communications firm scored a cool R35 million before the department approved its work. Both the tender and the bidding process contravened the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). According to the SIU, of the R150 million paid to the company, R25 million went towards the NHI media campaign, while the remaining R125 million was paid for work on Covid-19 projects. Meanwhile, the SIU has been granted an order to freeze R22 million in bank accounts linked to Digital Vibes. Compiled by Vhahangwele Nemakonde. Additional reporting by News24 Wire
