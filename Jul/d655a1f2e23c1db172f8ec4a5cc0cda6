Non-emergency medical services are being scaled back at Western Cape health department facilities to reduce the number of contacts as Covid-19 cases increase. “We understand this might be an inconvenience to some, but it is important to remember why we are doing this – to ensure we have sufficient capacity to provide emergency medical care to those with life-threatening conditions and those who are admitted with Covid-19,” the department announced on Wednesday. The decision comes as the third wave of Covid-19 infections takes hold across the country. Gauteng and the Western Cape recorded the most new cases in recent days. In response, the Western Cape Department of Health has decided to cut back on patient contact time at its facilities, except for emergencies and certain essential services. This means: The department has urged people to only go to hospitals for emergencies. The following emergency services will continue: Primary healthcare clinics will also scale down services. They will dispense medication that will last for longer periods where possible, non-urgent appointments will be postponed and alternative dates given, and dental services and eye care will be limited to emergencies only. Midwife obstetric units will continue to operate, and there will be limited medication delivery to stable chronic patients. Essential clinic services will continue, such as tuberculosis and HIV screening and treatment, chronic care, family planning, immunisations and antenatal and postnatal care. The call centre number for further information is 0860 142 142.
