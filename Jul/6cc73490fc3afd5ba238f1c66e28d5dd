The Pietermaritzburg High Court has dismissed, with costs, former President Jacob Zuma’s urgent application to have his imprisonment stayed. Judge Bhekisisa Mnguni delivered the judgement on Friday morning, without explaining the basis of his decision to dismiss the application. Mnguni had reserved the judgement on Tuesday after he heard a long day of arguments between Zuma’s counsel, Advocate Dali Mpofu, and Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, representing the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture.
