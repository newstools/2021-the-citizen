President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the extension of South Africa’s adjusted Alert Level 4 lockdown for another 14 days, with some changes to the current restrictions. This is after the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) met earlier on Sunday to review the current Level 4 restrictions and adjustments. Level 4 lockdown was set to end at midnight on 11 July, with having Ramaphosa announced its implementation for two weeks during the previous family meeting in June. With more than 2.1 million Covid-19 cases reported in the country to date and over 64,000 deaths, the President has indicated that Level 4 would remain in place as it was too early to see the impact of the two-week lockdown on the infection numbers while the healthcare sector battles with the Delta variant. “As things stand now infections remain very high. The third wave is more severe than the 1st and 2nd wave,” the President said during Sunday night’s nation address. The President said the country’s curfew remains in place from 9pm to 4am.
