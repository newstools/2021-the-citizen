The Gauteng health department on Monday rolled out its mobile vaccination drive, starting in Ekurhuleni, Tshwane and Johannesburg. As part of the programme, people eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine will be transported free of charge by buses from local pickup points, the department said. In addition, the mobile units will visit Sassa pay points to vaccinate social grant recipients who are eligible to get the vaccine. Anyone above the age of 50 may get the vaccine, provided they bring along their ID card, driver’s licence or a signed affidavit. The department said “each vaccination brings us one step closer to a better future”, and call on residents to “minimise the spread of the disease and flatten the curve”. “We call on all Gauteng residents to get vaccinated when their turn comes”. Furthermore, the department reiterated all public vaccinations sites in Gauteng accept walk-ins, but only for eligible groups.
