Another notable nominee is Motshwari, who was also in line to win the MTN8 Last Man Standing, only to be beaten by Hotto. Motshwari has been consistent for the Buccaneers despite the stiff competition in the midfield at the Soweto giants. The midfielder made over 30 appearances for the club competing in the league, the MTN8, Nedbank Cup and the Caf Confederation Cup. Monare, who was also a consistent player in Bucs in his first season with the club got the nod for his performances in midfield.
