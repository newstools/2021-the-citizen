Winter is not a great time for your car battery and if it is not in a good condition, it will probably fail during these colder months. A vehicle’s engine requires more power to start when it is cold and at the same time the colder temperatures make it more difficult for a car battery to provide the power that it normally does. Getting stranded with a flat battery is more serious than in years gone by. Cars these days are equipped with a myriad of electronics that all rely on the correct battery voltage to perform optimally. Automatic gearboxes found in most cars these days also mean that it is not possible to push start your car and sensitive electronics can be damaged by jump-starting vehicles incorrectly. “In normal circumstances a car battery needs to be changed approximately every three years. With many people driving less or infrequently due to the on-going work-from-home trend, the normal three-year lifespan could be considerably shorter,” says the CEO of Motus Retail and Rental SA, Corné Venter. As batteries get older, they require a longer running time to fully recharge after the heavy load of starting a vehicle, so if you generally only travel short distances the battery will not have enough time to sufficiently recharge. If your battery is running out of time or you cannot remember when it was last replaced, it is a good idea to have it checked to ascertain if it still has some life left in it. Most battery retailers will perform this check free of charge. Find your nearest Motus dealer and book a service here.
