Former President Jacob Zuma has admitted he was wrong to think that he could not be forced to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, and conceded he was legally ill-advised. Zuma made these concessions in his application to the Constitutional Court to rescind Tuesday’s ruling, which found him in contempt of court and sentenced him to 15 months in prison. “I now fully accept that the most legally appropriate route which I could and should have taken would have been to apply for interim relief to interdict my appearance before the commission,” Zuma said in court papers.
