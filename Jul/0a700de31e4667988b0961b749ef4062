The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) says it has been unable to access crime scenes and bodies in incidents where people are alleged to have died as a result of police action due to the ongoing unrest. On Tuesday, the police watchdog said that SAPS was under strain, and in one incident, investigators were unable to reach the scene at a Shoprite in Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal, where a person had died after rioters attacked their vehicles. “In this regard, the department calls on the members of the community to understand that the IPID investigators are not able to attend crime scenes of cases report”d to us, as well as reaching the deceased bodies, due to the chaos in the areas where protests are taking place,” said Ipid.
