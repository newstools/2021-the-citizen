Friday nights are for forgetting about your weekday troubles, and kicking back to relax and destress. After the super busy and stressful work-week you have had, the last thing you want to do is spend hours in the kitchen preparing a meal for yourself and the family. Spend less time preparing dinner and more time on the things you love doing in the spirit of self-care. These tuna patties are easy to prepare, and their juicy and delicious taste will have you going back for seconds. Bake or buy some fresh hamburger rolls to create yummy tuna patty burgers!
