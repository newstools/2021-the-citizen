They don’t give it to anyone. Ntshangase was highly rated when he joined and that’s why her was handed the number. Now that he is gone, the club are still looking for someone to take the role.“It is not only about carrying the number at the back, but also about carrying the team on the field.

Ekstein left Chiefs for an overseas move three years ago after he couldn’t agree on a new deal with them. Buchanan’s stay at Naturena was hampered by injury but he proved himself again at Maritzburg United and could make a return to Naturena where he feels he has a point to prove.As reported earlier, Newly promoted DStv Premiership side, Sekhukhune United have decided against signing former Chiefs midfielder, Siphelele “Stash” Ntshangase.A source close to the Limpopo based side said Ntshangase was among a number of players invited to train with the club ahead of the new season so that the technical team can have a closer look. “He had been there since Monday when they opened.

He didn’t pitch up for Thursday’s training and I heard he had gone back home,” said a source.
