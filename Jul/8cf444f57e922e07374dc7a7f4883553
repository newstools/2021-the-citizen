Reports of unrest across parts of Johannesburg have been shared on social media on Sunday morning, 11 July, presumably as part of the ‘Gauteng Shutdown’ protest action. Here’s what we know. Yusuf Abramjee on Saturday said reports of unrest have been streaming in from Jeppestown, Denver and Alexandra. In addition, the Joburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) warned of protest action on the M2 near the Denver exit. “Both the east- and westbound are blocked off by rocks and burning tyres. Officers have been deployed; road users are advised to use alternative routes”, the department said. A video shared on social media shows a burned-down church, shops and other buildings while stores are being looted in Jeppestown, Johannesburg.

(@IndWorldThinker) July 11, 2021 South Africans have been criticising the protests on social media. One citizen said he is “very disappointed about what s happening [in South Africa], people who should be blamed are top officials [because] they failed to solve their problems”. Another added: “That’s their aim, to loot people’s shops, nothing else. Zuma is in Escourt, why don’t they go and shut down the police station? Here in [Johannesburg], it’s gonna be war”.
