He claimed banks were targeting black people’s assets during the Covid-19 pandemic, even though many people had lost their jobs. “We are tired of the racism meted out to black people by these racist banks. We are tired of being victimised and facing account closures and repossession of our assets, be it our cars or houses. “Students cannot go to school because education is not free and now they are even denied loans because they are classified as credit risks. Parents cannot afford houses because they are either unemployed, unemployable or also classified as risk. But according to who?” asked Nchabeleng.
