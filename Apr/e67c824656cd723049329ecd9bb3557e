This is becoming more and more common with this Bank, definitely the worst level of service I have seen in 20yrs….and getting worse. No feedback at any stage from the bank which is also now common, really piss poor internet services.” pic.twitter.com/HSq140K51O — Choushi Choshi (@ChoushiChoshi) April 30, 2021  @StandardBank app is never working and now I can’t even get OTP for internet banking. pic.twitter.com/qXqDDVEKlc — TheLovedOne (@Oagile_Atha) April 30, 2021  Standard Bank said it is aware of the issues, including people unable to receive one-time passwords to login to internet banking services.
