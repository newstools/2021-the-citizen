Twenty-five prisoners have now been recaptured in KwaZulu Natal after a police vehicle was brazenly attacked by an armed gang in Pietermaritzburg. “This now brings the number of prisoners who are still on the run down to 20,” said Police spokesperson Captain Jay Naicker. “They were part of a group of 45 inmates who were being transported from New Prison to the magistrate’s court,” said Naicker. Naicker said a police vehicle was blocked by gunmen with AK 47s on the train bridge in Edendale on Wednesday. He said a manhunt had since been launched.
