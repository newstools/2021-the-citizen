Piet Retief murder accused Daniel Malan, Cornelius Greyling, Othard Klingberg, Michael Sternberg and Zenzele Yende were granted bail on Friday morning. The men were arrested three weeks ago following the death of Amos and Zenzele Coka at the Pampoenkraal farm in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga. The Piet Retief Magistrate’s Court agreed with the defence’s argument the men should be released and that it would be in the interests of justice. They were released on bail of R10 000 each. Public order police were deployed around the courthouse, as possible unrest was anticipated due to previous incidents of violence during their earlier court appearances.

The defence said the protestors had assaulted another farmer before the fatal shooting.
