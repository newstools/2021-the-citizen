A motorist who seemingly attempted to drive into the News Cafe restaurant in Rosebank, Johannesburg, after an altercation with bouncers appeared at the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Peter Sefako was charged with reckless and negligent driving and driving while under the influence of alcohol. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said Sefako was arrested on Friday and made his first court appearance. In a statement, the restaurant management said the man walked into the restaurant and “randomly” insulted and antagonised patrons and staffers.

He was subsequently arrested by the Rosebank police and no one was injured.” In a video showing the incident, security guards are seen gathering around a vehicle in an attempt to stop the man, but he continues to reverse and rams into the walls of the restaurant and the tables outside. According to one patron, Sefako reportedly arrived there to see his ex-girlfriend, who is a waitress and she refused to speak to him. Watch the clip below.
