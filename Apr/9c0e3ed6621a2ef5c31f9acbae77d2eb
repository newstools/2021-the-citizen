RACE 3 NO 2 IRISH RAIN AND NO 10 RAINY SEASON – SWINGER The scratching of Genie from this race has turned this race into a two-horse affair and the Swinger with Irish Rain and Rainy Season looks a very good bet. Remember, it means both runners have to finish in the first three, in any position an order. RACE 4 NO 6 BROADWAY BABE – EACHWAY This Brett Webber-trained runner just won her maiden last time out but the form of all of her races has been very strong and has produced a number of winners. Broadway Babe is currently quoted at 14-1 and is a must to be included in Swingers, Trifectas and Quartets as well.
