 A whopping pool of R12 million is expected for the Pick 6 at Turffontein’s Champion Day race meeting on Saturday. With TAB getting things rolling with an R4-million carryover and a feast of top-class racing on offer, excited punters will be piling into the popular exotic bet. However, not many players will be bothering to study form for Leg 5 of the Pick 6, the Grade 1 Premier’s Champions Challenge, and will swiftly bang in all three of the titans that face off in an eagerly awaited duel: Got The Greenlight, Summer Pudding and Malmoos. Choosing between them seems like folly. Bookmakers have priced up the race at 14-1 bar, with the terrific trio lumped together at 2-1. TAB has also put up an R2-million carryover for a Quartet Maxipool on Race 7, the Grade 1 Computaform Sprint. An R5-million pot is predicted. Other exotic bet pools expected are R800,000 for the PA and Jackpot 1, R400,000 for the BiPot, R250,000 for Jackpot 2 and R150,000 for the Pick 3 starting in Race 8.
