Race 4 No 2 Arizona Lady She was only caught late in her last run and she will be more suited to the Inside track which will suit her style of racing. Also has a top work rider aboard. VALUE BET Race 3 No 2 Royal Mazarin This horse has decent form over this distance and the only reason one is getting a good price is because he comes from an unfashionable stable. Nice each way bet.
