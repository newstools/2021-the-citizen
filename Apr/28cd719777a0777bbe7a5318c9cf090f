 Mamelodi Sundowns co-head coach Manqoba Mngqithi said Kaizer Chiefs didn’t deserve to end their unbeaten record in the DStv Premiership, after Amakhosi won 2-1 against Masandawana at Loftus Versveld Stadium on Sunday.

The Sundowns co-head coach was disappointed his side had not killed off the game after Gaston Sirino gave them a first half lead, and also refused to blame luck after Samir Nurkovic’s cross had deflected in off Mosa Lebusa for the equaliser. “I think this is a game we could have wrapped up earlier, we messed around and resorted to ball possession when we could have penetrated. Even in the second half we had a big chance to score a second but we didn’t and on the counter we lost possession and instead of blocking the opponent and making sure the don’t go past we let them loose. You may say there was a deflection, but there is no luck in football, luck is when hard work meets opportunity.”
