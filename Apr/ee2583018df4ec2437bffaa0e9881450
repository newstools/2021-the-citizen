 Celebrities are no longer a single brand, they are now branching out into other brands and multiple revenue streams other than remaining an actor or singer. One such personality is Moshe Ndiki who started off as a comedian, with his videos going viral that then led to TV appearances, hosting and eventually acting. His latest venture, like his friend Somizi Mhlongo, is in the food industry. Ndiki has announced a new spice range that is MSG free, halal and vegan friendly, called Moshe’s Kitchen. In a statement, it read this has been a five-year journey in  food, first starting as “an established catering company after his postgrad qualification” with his “hustle” leading Ndiki into food science. He says the spice range is inspired by his childhood memories and a way to honour his mother and other family members. Moshe’s Kitchen focuses on healthier spice options with less salt to lessen the risk of heart disease prevalent in lower income communities. It includes chicken spice, BBQ, braai grill, steak n chops, curry spice and five more flavours.
