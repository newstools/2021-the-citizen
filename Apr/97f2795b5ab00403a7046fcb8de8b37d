Khloe Kardashian and her baby’s father, Tristan Thompson, are back together as a couple after being separated for a year due to Tristan’s infinitely scandalous past. Instagram model Sydney Chase made a recent appearance on the No Jumper podcast. On the podcast she claimed she and Tristan had hooked up at the very beginning of this year. Chase said: “He told me he was not in a relationship any more, so I said okay. We talked, we hung out multiple times, we went out together, everything.” Sydney made it clear on the podcast she asked the NBA basketball star if he was single, to which Tristan “yes”. “It happened. Then I found out he was not single and I cut him off,” Chase said.   A post shared by Sydney????

Initially Khloe blamed Jordyn for the hookup, but later turned the blame to Tristan after facing backlash from the public. “Jordyn is not to be blamed for the breakup of my family.
