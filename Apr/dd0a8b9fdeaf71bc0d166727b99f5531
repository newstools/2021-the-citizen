All eyes are now on Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo’s reaction to a report on financial misconduct and corruption at the Johannesburg Property Company (JPC) relating to Covid-19 expenditure. Five senior employees including CEO Helen Botes and CFO Imraam Bhamjee may be guilty of financial misconduct, according to the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) report. On Friday, the mayor in a statement confirmed he had received the report from the SIU. The report stems from the awarding of Covid-19 deep-cleaning contracts worth nearly R19 million to four service providers, allegedly at “inflated prices.” Makhubo said the report had been referred to economic development MMV Lawrence Khoza, acting city manager Floyd Brink, JPC board chairperson Moeketsi Rabodila JPC acting CEO Ruby Mathang for consideration and action. “The report has adverse findings and we have directed the board of JPC to provide us with a clear and concise approach to ensuring we discipline and charge those employees identified to have acted improperly,” Makhubo said. Makhubo said the JPC board had undertaken to act decisively and in line with its fiduciary duties in ensuring accountability and consequence management in matters emanating from the investigations.
