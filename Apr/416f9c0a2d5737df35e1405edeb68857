Wales round off their schedule against the Wallabies, aiming for a third consecutive win against them for just the second time since the two teams first met in 1908. “This is a huge autumn series fixture list and we are already looking forward to it, especially with the prospect of having supporters back at Principality Stadium,” said head coach Pivac, whose team won the 2021 Six Nations, played behind closed doors due to coronavirus restrictions. “It would be close to 21 months since we have had the chance to play in front of our fans at our home stadium, so it is hugely exciting to have the fixtures announced.” The Welsh Rugby Union is hoping to stage the matches in front of a capacity 74 500 crowd as Covid-19 restrictions are eased across Britain. Steve Phillips, WRU Group CEO said: “It is our aim and ambition to deliver the Autumn Nations Series 2021 with full crowds. “We are working alongside Welsh government and Public Health Wales to ensure this is done correctly and safely.”
