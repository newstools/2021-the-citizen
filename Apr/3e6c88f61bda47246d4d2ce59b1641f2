 The Stormers are bracing themselves for a reunion with their former captain Siya Kolisi when they host the Sharks in their Rainbow Cup opener at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. This is the first time Kolisi will return to his former stomping ground, but Stormers forwards coach Rito Hlungwani isn’t too concerned about what Kolisi can share about his former team.

It’s no different to other teams analysing one another. ” Siya Kolisi during a Sharks training session.

Hlungwani, however, was more concerned about the Sharks’ kicking game, especially with flyhalf Curwin Bosch who caught the Stormers wanting when the Sharks surprised the home team in the Currie Cup playoff. In that game Bosch punished the Stormers for their ill discipline and converted several penalties into points which formed the basis of the Sharks’ surprising win. The Sharks have always had a good kicking game and it has worked really well for them, and the Stormers predict that they won’t be changing that this weekend. “We just want to handle those pressures and adapt during the game,” Hlungwani said.
