Trade union Solidarity was disappointed in Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Lindiwe Sisulu for allegedly changing the story regarding the 24 Cuban engineers brought to SA to assist with ailing water infrastructure. “At first she said there were no South Africans at all [who could do it] and now there were five companies that were not good enough, or as good as, the Cuban engineers,” spokesman Morne Malan said.

Now they cry foul,” he said. A search for Sisulu’s call yielded no results. However, according to the department’s Sputnik Ratau, “it was known since 2019”.

But Sisulu emphasised the Cubans were not here for employment, but “to mentor municipal workers”.
