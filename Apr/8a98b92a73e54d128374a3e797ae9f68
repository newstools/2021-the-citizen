 World champion Lewis Hamilton said on Thursday he is ready to join this weekend’s widespread sports boycott of social media in a stand against racism even if Formula 1 is not convinced. “I think I probably will follow and support this weekend,” said Hamilton on the sidelines of the Portuguese Grand Prix. A coalition of football organisations including the English Football Association and Premier League revealed they would not post on their channels this weekend and the boycott has grown, with other sports bodies, sponsors and broadcasters joining in. On Friday, UEFA also said it would follow suit.

Not sure,” said McLaren driver Lando Norris. A Formula 1 spokesman said the ruling body will not commit to the boycott which gets underway on Friday. “We support the actions of the Premier League and other sporting bodies and athletes in highlighting that more must be done to eradicate online abuse that they are receiving directly,” he said. “However, we continue to work with all platforms and our own audiences to promote respect and positive values and put a stop to racism.”
