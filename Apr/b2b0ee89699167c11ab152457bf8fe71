Safa were initially supposed to announce the man to replace Molefi Ntseki last weekend but postponed, citing traveling issues due to Covid-19 restrictions as the reason. But as the week went on, rumours started circulating that the coach they had approach had done a U-turn on them, and they were left clutching at straws trying to find another. Reports coming out of Egypt suggested that Safa had tried to convince Pitso Mosimane to leave Al Ahly and come back home to coach Bafana, but refused. The names of the likes of Carlos Queiroz, Hugo Broos and Herve Renard have been thrown around and said to have been part of the list of five recommended by Safa’s technical team after sitting through CV’s of applicants.
